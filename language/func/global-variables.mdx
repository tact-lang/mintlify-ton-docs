## Declaration

**A global variable** is declared using the `global` keyword, followed by the variable's type and name. For example:

```func
global ((int, int) -> int) op;
```

This defines global variable `op` of type `(int, int) -> int`. In other words, `op` can store a function that receives two arguments and returns an integer.

Here is an example that uses global variable `op`:

```func
global ((int, int) -> int) op;

int check_commutative(int a, int b) {
  return op(a, b) == op(b, a);
}

int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}

int main() {
  op = add;
  return check_commutative(2, 3);
}
```

The example defines two auxiliary functions: `check_commutative` and `add`, in addition to the program entry point [`main`](#special-functions#main).
Function `check_commutative` checks if the operator stored in the global variable `op` satisfies the commutative property for the specified inputs `a` and `b`.
Function `add`, adds its two inputs.
Function `main` assigns the addition function `add` to the global variable `op`. Then, it verifies the commutativity of addition for the specific values: `2`, `3`.

In FunC, you can _omit the type_ of global variables. In this case, the compiler determines the type based on how the variable is used. Equivalently,
instead of declaring the type, you can use the `var` keyword as a replacement for the type.

For example, in the previous program you can declare the variable `op` as:

```func
global op;
```

or as:

```func
global var op;
```

<Aside>
  Under the hood, global variables in FunC are stored in the `c7` control register of the TVM, with a maximum limit of 31 variables.

  Global variables do _not_ allow initialization during declaration, contrary to local variables, which must be initialized during declaration.
  For example,

  ```func
  global int a = 5;  ;; DOES NOT COMPILE
  ```

  Reading a global variable that has not been assigned, will result in the [`null` value](types#null-values).

## Multiple declarations

FunC allows users to declare multiple global variables using a single `global` keyword.

The following example:

```func
global int A;
global cell B;
global C;
```

is equivalent to this:

```func
global int A, cell B, C;
```

## Restrictions on declarations

A local variable **cannot** have the same name of a previously declared global variable **but only if their types differ**.

The following example does not compile, because the local variable `C` of type `int` has the same name as the global variable `C` of type `cell`,
and `int` and `cell` are different types.

```func
global cell C;

int main() {
  int C = 3; ;; DOES NOT COMPILE
  return C;
}
```

However, if the local variable and the global variable have the same type and the same name, the declaration of the local variable actually means assignment
to the global variable. For example,

```func
global int C;

int main() {
  int C = 3;
  return C;
}
```

In this case, `int C = 3;` is not declaring a new local variable, but instead assigning value `3` to the global variable `C`.
