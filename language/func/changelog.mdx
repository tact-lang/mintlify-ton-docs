## Initial version

The initial version of FunC was developed by Telegram, but active development stopped after May 2020.
We refer to the May 2020 release as the initial version.

## Version 0.1.0

Released in [2022-05](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/releases/tag/v2022.05/).

### New features

- [Constants](literals#constants)
- [Compile-time built-ins](literals#compile-time-built-ins)
- [`#pragma` version](compiler-directives#pragma-version)
- [Includes](compiler-directives#%23include)

### Fixes

- Resolved rare bugs in `Asm.fif`.

## Version 0.2.0

Released in [2022-08](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/releases/tag/v2022.08/).

### New features

- Unbalanced `if/else` branches, where some branches return a value while others do not

### Fixes

- FunC incorrectly handles `while(false)` loops [(issue #377)](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/issues/377/).
- FunC generates incorrect code for `if/else` branches [(issue #374)](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/issues/374/).
- FunC incorrectly returns from conditions in inline functions [(issue #370)](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/issues/370/).
- `Asm.fif`: splitting large function bodies incorrectly interferes with inline [(issue #375)](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/issues/375/).

## Version 0.3.0

Released in [2022-10](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/releases/tag/v2022.10/).

### New features

- Support for [multi-line `asm` statements](functions#multi-line-asms)
- Allow duplicate definitions of identical constants and `asm` statements
- Enable bitwise operations for constants

## Version 0.4.0

Released in [2023-01](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/releases/tag/v2023.01/).

### New features

- [`try/catch` statements](statements#try%E2%80%A6catch-statement)
- [`throw_arg` functions](built-ins#throw-arg)
- Support for in-place modification and mass assignment of global variables, e.g., `a~inc()` and `(a, b) = (3, 5)`, where `a` is global

### Fixes

- Disallowed ambiguous modification of local variables after their use in the same expression. For example, `var x = (ds, ds~load_uint(32), ds~load_uint(64));` is forbidden, while `var x = (ds~load_uint(32), ds~load_uint(64), ds);` is allowed.
- Allowed empty inline functions.
- Fixed a rare optimization bug in `while` loops.
