<Aside>

  The official language of TON Blockchain is [Tolk](/language/tolk), and all other languages are deemed legacy. That said, you can still use them and contribute to the surrounding tooling or documentation.

</Aside>

**FunC** is a low-level language used to program smart contracts on TON. It is a domain-specific, C-like, statically typed language. Here is a simple example of a method for sending money written in FunC:

```func
() send_money(slice address, int amount) impure inline {
    var msg = begin_cell()
        .store_uint(0x10, 6) ;; nobounce
        .store_slice(address)
        .store_coins(amount)
        .end_cell();

    send_raw_message(msg, 64);
}
```

The compiler converts FunC programs into Fift assembler code, generating the corresponding bytecode for the [TON Virtual Machine](/tvm).

Developers and engineers can use its bytecode, which is structured as a [tree of cells](/v3/concepts/dive-into-ton/ton-blockchain/cells-as-data-storage/) like all data in the TON Blockchain, to create smart contracts or run it on a local instance of the TVM.

## Compiler

### Compile with JS

Using the Blueprint framework is the most convenient and quickest way to begin developing and compiling smart contracts. Read more in the [Blueprint](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/getting-started/javascript/) section.

```bash
npm create ton@latest
```

### Compile with original binaries

FunC compiler binaries for Windows, macOS (Intel or Arm64), and Ubuntu can be downloaded from the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/releases/latest).

## TON Blockchain course

The [TON Blockchain course](https://stepik.org/course/176754/) covers FunC and smart contract development in its 4th module.
