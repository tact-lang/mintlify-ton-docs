The TON ecosystem is built around two layers of tools.
**Production-facing infrastructure** delivers the live services that power interaction with the blockchain.
**Developer-facing tooling** provides the utilities required to build, test, and deploy those services.

The sections below outline both layers.

## Production-facing infrastructure

Describe the flow of data through

- Wallet apps: full-fledged GUI for writing to blockchain
- SDKs: libraries for reading/writing to blockchain
- RPC providers: HTTP APIs used under the hood by sdks for reading/writing to blockchain
- Blockchain node: collaborates with other nodes in handling reading/writing requests
- Explorers: full-fledged GUI for reading from blockchain
- TON Connect: library for user interface for reading/writing to blockchain
- Network status dashboards: pages to check if ecosystem is healthy


## Developer-facing tooling

- Blueprint
- IDE
- Testing frameworks
- AI-assisted tools


TMA is lost. Should it be noted here?
