# Overview
This page provides an overview of Tonviewer, the TON blockchain explorer.

## What is Tonviewer
Tonviewer is the TON blockchain explorer that lets you inspect blocks, transactions, contracts, and tokens.

## Key capabilities
- Search by address, transaction hash, message hash or block:
> Examples:
> - `UQD5mxRgCuRNLxKxeOjG6r14iSroLF5FtomPnet-sgP5xI-e` or `Binance`
> - `421a98de86864a05dd024f5e0e7e584c9eb8ba11fa11c88c4a5658acd23a376c`
> - `/ql+i1av9h9v/VJV5VVDmIP5OOlcQoorhjjft9s+0Sg=`
> - `0,8000000000000000,57149294`
- Address: balance and assets (Jettons, NFTs), fiat portfolio value, activity history, contract code and data, run get‑methods.
- Blocks and validators: detailed block card, links to adjacent and key blocks, transaction count, masterchain/prev‑refs, merge/split flags and the key block indicator, used blockchain config and download BoC button.

  - Raw Transactions – low‑level messages and receipts.
  - Tokens – jetton wallets of this address with balances and links to a specific token.
  - Collectibles – NFTs owned by the address with links to item pages.
  - Code – contract code and data in raw/decoded view (where supported).

  - Send Message – send an arbitrary message/call to the address.

### Jetton wallet page

- Jetton wallet: address of the jetton‑wallet contract (per‑token wallet).

- History: table with date/time, direction (Send/Received/Mint), counterparty, optional comment/data and amount.
- History controls: sort by date and additional actions (row menu).

### NFT page
- NFT header: title, link to Metadata/Content, quick link to a marketplace (e.g., Getgems), preview image/media.
- Address: contract address of the NFT item.
- Balance: native TON balance on the NFT address (usually small).
- Contract type: nft_item.
- Collection: collection card with name, address, and a link to the collection page.
- Status and links: activity indicator, utility links (e.g., ton.cx, toncoin.org).
- Owner: current owner (TON address link).
- Collection address: the collection contract address this NFT belongs to.
- History: History tab with deploy/transfer/contract called events, date/time, counterparty, comment, and amount (in TON if paid).
- Technical tabs: Raw Transactions, Code, Methods, Send Message.

### NFT collection page
- Collection header: name, avatar/preview, link to Metadata.
- Collection address and owner (if exposed by the contract).

## Typical scenarios
- [Check an address balance and recent activity](#check-an-address-balance-and-recent-activity)
- [Trace a transaction: inputs/outputs, fees, related messages, errors](#trace-a-transaction)
- [Inspect a contract: code, storage, method calls](#inspect-a-contract)
- [Check NFTs for an address](#check-nfts-for-an-address)

### Check balance and recent activity
1. Open Tonviewer: [tonviewer.com](https://tonviewer.com)
2. Paste an address into search bar
3. Explore the header for balance and history tab to see the recent activity

### Trace a transaction
1. Open Tonviewer: [tonviewer.com](https://tonviewer.com)
2. Paste a transaction or message hash into search bar
3. Review the trace header: status (Confirmed/Failed), timestamp and duration.
4. In Event Overview, see high‑level actions (e.g., Transfer TON/Jetton), the route (sender → recipient), decoded payload/comment and the value transferred. Hover a row to highlight the underlying message.
5. Click Show details to inspect low‑level data. Key blocks you will see:
  - Transaction summary: Block ID, Tx hash, Prev. tx hash, Lt/Prev tx lt, Status (e.g., active → active), State hash change, Type tx (e.g., TransOrd), Aborted/Destroyed flags.
  - Fees: Total fee, Forward fee, Gas fee, Storage fee, Action fee, and the resulting End balance.
  - Compute Phase: Success, Exit code (0 = success), VM steps and Gas used.
  - Action Phase: Success, Result code, Total actions and Skipped actions.
  - Internal message(s): Destination, Value, Forward Fee, IHR disabled, Created at/lt, Hash, Bounced and Bounce flags, Init (if present).
  - Utilities: Copy Raw transaction, open in retracer, and links to alternate explorers (ton.cx, toncoin.org).
  - For developers might very useful to inspect the transaction in [TxTracer](https://txtracer.ton.org/).
6. Open the Transactions Tree tab to trace internal calls across contracts. Expand nodes to follow the full execution path and amounts moving through each hop.
7. Open the Value Flow tab to see an aggregated view of transferred value vs fees (TON and tokens where applicable).
8. Use linked addresses, messages and blocks to navigate to related objects (sender/recipient, parent/child messages, containing block).
9. For failing transactions, check Exit code/Result code and Compute details to identify the reason (e.g., invalid op, not enough balance, access control) and which hop produced the error. Inspect Internal message flags (Bounced/Bounce) for bounce behavior. For error meaning, refer to TVM exit codes and the contract code.

### Inspect a contract
1. Open Tonviewer: [tonviewer.com](https://tonviewer.com)
2. Paste a contract address into search bar
3. Review the contract header: type (e.g., wallet_v4r2 or a custom contract), status (e.g., active/uninit/nonexist/frozen)
4. Open the Code tab to inspect the contract code if it was verified, otherwise you will see the raw cell.
5. Open the Methods tab to run get‑methods, explorer will index only methods that can be called without parameters (e.g., seqno, get_public_key), but you can run any method by typing it in the input field and clicking execute.

### Check NFTs for an address
1. Open Tonviewer: [tonviewer.com](https://tonviewer.com)
2. Paste an address into search bar
3. Open the Collectibles tab to see the NFTs owned by the address.
4. Click on an NFT to see the NFT page.
