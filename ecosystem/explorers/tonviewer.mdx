title: "Using Tonviewer"
---

Tonviewer is a TON Blockchain explorer that allows you to inspect blocks, transactions, contracts, and tokens, as well as analyze activity.

## High-level entities

High-level entities provide the foundation for exploring TON Blockchain, understanding and tracking operations.
They are essential for identifying transactions and tracing data flow across the network.

- **Accounts** are the primary entities representing participants on the blockchain.
- In Tonviewer, you interact with **account addresses**, which uniquely identify participants and their activity.
- **Messages** are instructions sent between addresses. They represent the actions that drive transactions on the network.
- Transactions


5. Blocks

## Failed use cases

1. jetton transfer: https://tonviewer.com/transaction/d7bf6b52060270b5b139034a192ec266e7844e1528c475208227aa26d20c77a0

https://tonviewer.com/transaction/71bd093a187bf8e78b582e3d8cd7274e034ecd2622c0b6c710ad3aab43f40584 (48 показывает это, нет газа)

Overall status reflects the outcome of the event, whereas transaction statuses reflect the outcomes of individual transactions.
![Status discrepancy](/resources/images/tonviewer/jetton-error.png)
In these examples, one event succeeded but the transaction failed because no computation was executed.
For jetton notification, computation is not required - only a record of a message.
In the second event, error 48 indicates `out of gas`; the transaction failed, preventing the actions required to complete the transfer.
Therefore, failed transactions do not necessarily imply a failed event.

2. nft transfer: https://tonviewer.com/transaction/d8b5dbfe1c115178f47b486d03982159ec8abe684cdbe1c75587293e877564d4 - Aigerim
3. swap: https://tonviewer.com/transaction/fa8e119f8911d20bb078b9b81a3fc1f8ff2bcc723eda3ac7e873e97f455812e7 - Dima

This example demonstrates that successful transactions do not guarantee a successful event.
![Status discrepancy: swap not executed](/resources/images/tonviewer/successful-failure.png)
Although the transactions succeeded, the swap was not executed, so the event failed.
The intended path was A -> E; subsequently, the D -> A transfer reverted the swap.


4. ton transfer: https://testnet.tonviewer.com/transaction/d263d75dda11c9629245f96b39796c0b52cdf0c2a154a3581d39a82205fd3b8d - Aigerim

1. high overview Tonviewer (показывает что уже случилось)
2. для чего нужен - для поиска, отслеживании операций
3. основные entities (high level enitites: accounts <-> address (account's property), msgs, trxs, blocks) - что это и для чего
4. use cases
- overview (на какие entities follow, exit codes, int-msg -> address, value/комиссии)

5. failed use cases
- описание кейса (описание трейса)
- описание "успешности" based on the detailed overview (4)
