Explorers are web tools for reading blockchain data. They let you look up accounts, transactions, blocks, and smart contracts, making it easy to verify activity and debug issues.

### Explorer
A blockchain explorer is a website that indexes on‑chain data and presents it in a searchable user interface (UI). In TON, explorers commonly show account balances, recent transactions, jettons and non‑fungible tokens (NFTs), contract code and state, and links to related blocks and messages.

### What explorers show
- Balances and assets: TON, jettons, and NFTs held by an address
- Transactions and messages: history, fees, phases, and traces
- Blocks and validators: block contents, MasterChain, and ShardChain details
- Smart contracts: code, state, disassembly, and known contract type
- Analytics: top entities, volumes, gas, fees, and network health

### Indexers
Indexers continuously read blocks from nodes, parse messages and transactions, and store them in a database optimized for queries. Explorers rely on these indexers to provide fast search, traces, higher‑level events, and historical views beyond what a single node exposes by default.
