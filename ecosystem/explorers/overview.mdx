Explorers are web tools for reading blockchain data. They let you look up accounts, transactions, blocks, and smart contracts, making it easy to verify activity and debug issues.

### What is an explorer?
A blockchain explorer is a website that indexes on‑chain data and presents it in a searchable UI. In TON, explorers commonly show account balances, recent transactions, Jettons/NFTs, contract code/state, and links to related blocks and messages.

### What can be found there?
- Balances and assets: TON, Jettons, NFTs held by an address
- Transactions and messages: history, fees, phases, traces
- Blocks and validators: block contents, master/shard details
- Smart contracts: code, state, disassembly, known contract type
- Analytics: top entities, volumes, gas/fees and network health

### What are indexers?
Indexers continuously read blocks from nodes, parse messages/transactions, and store them in a database optimized for queries. Explorers rely on these indexers to provide fast search, traces, higher‑level events, and historical views beyond what a single node exposes out of the box.
