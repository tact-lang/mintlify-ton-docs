MyLocalTon packages validator nodes, a lite-server, explorer, and optional HTTP API into a single JAR so you can prototype locally without touching mainnet. Use it for integration tests, smart-contract dry runs, and demos before deploying to public networks.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 or newer in your `PATH`.
- Python 3.x if you plan to enable the optional HTTP API bridge.
- On Windows, install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2015+ x64 Redistributable.
- Allocate at least 4 CPU cores, 16 GB RAM, and 20 GB of free disk space for smooth operation.

## Download and install

### Windows

1. Install the Visual C++ Redistributable.
2. Download the JAR that matches your architecture from the [MyLocalTon releases](https://github.com/neodix42/MyLocalTon/releases).
   - `MyLocalTon-x86-64.jar` for x86-64 systems.
   - `MyLocalTon-arm64.jar` for ARM64 systems.

### macOS and Linux

```bash
# x86-64
wget https://github.com/neodix42/MyLocalTon/releases/latest/download/MyLocalTon-x86-64.jar
# ARM64
wget https://github.com/neodix42/MyLocalTon/releases/latest/download/MyLocalTon-arm64.jar
```

Grant execute permissions if you prefer to run the JAR directly: `chmod +x MyLocalTon-*.jar`.

### Build from source

```bash
sudo apt install default-jdk ant maven
git clone https://github.com/neodix42/MyLocalTon.git
cd MyLocalTon
mvn clean package assembly:single
```

The packaged JARs appear under `target/` when the build finishes.

## Launch the local network

```bash
java -jar MyLocalTon-x86-64.jar
```

Useful arguments:

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `nogui` | Run in headless mode without the Swing interface. |
| `with-validators=<N>` | Start `N` validator instances (default: 1). |
| `explorer` | Launch the bundled block explorer. |
| `ton-http-api` | Start the HTTP API bridge (requires Python + `ton-http-api`). |
| `custom-binaries=<PATH>` | Load TON binaries from a custom directory. |
| `ip.addr.X.X` | Bind services to a specific local IP. |
| `debug` | Increase log verbosity for troubleshooting. |

The first run creates the `myLocalTon/` workspace alongside the JAR. Validators, liteserver certificates, and logs live in this directory.

## Connect CLI tools

MyLocalTon prints the lite-server public key during startup and stores certificates in `./myLocalTon/genesis/bin/certs/`.

```bash
lite-client -a 127.0.0.1:4443 -b <BASE64_PUBLIC_KEY> -c last
validator-engine-console \
  -a 127.0.0.1:4441 \
  -k $(pwd)/myLocalTon/genesis/bin/certs/client \
  -p $(pwd)/myLocalTon/genesis/bin/certs/server.pub
```

Replace `<BASE64_PUBLIC_KEY>` with the key printed in the MyLocalTon logs.

## Enable the HTTP API bridge

Install Python dependencies on the host system, then restart MyLocalTon with the `ton-http-api` flag.

```bash
# Linux
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip
pip3 install --user ton-http-api

# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install python3
python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade
pip3 install --user ton-http-api

# Windows
py -3 -m ensurepip --upgrade
py -3 -m pip install --user ton-http-api
```

The bridge exposes REST endpoints that mirror the lite-server APIs for tooling that cannot speak the native ADNL protocol.

## Monitor and maintain

- Tail `myLocalTon/MyLocalTon.log` for application-level events.
- Validator logs reside in `myLocalTon/genesis/db/log`.
- Re-run with `debug` when reproducing issues.
- Upgrade by downloading the latest JAR, replacing the existing file, and deleting the `myLocalTon` directory so the genesis state regenerates.

:::caution
MyLocalTon is alpha software. Do not expose it to the public internet or connect production wallets without additional sandboxing. For containerized workflows, use the dedicated [MyLocalTon Docker images](https://github.com/neodix42/MyLocalTon/tree/master/docker).

## Troubleshooting tips

| Symptom | Resolution |
| --- | --- |
| JAR fails to start | Verify Java 21+ is installed and the file is not quarantined by the OS (macOS: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <JAR>`). |
| Lite-client handshake fails | Confirm you are using the current public key from startup logs and that ports 4441/4443 are free. |
| HTTP API errors | Ensure Python 3 and `ton-http-api` are installed globally or in the same user context as MyLocalTon. |
| Need a clean reset | Stop the process, delete the `myLocalTon` folder, and restart the JAR to regenerate the network. |
