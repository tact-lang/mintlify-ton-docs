## Account inspection

### `vas`

#### Purpose
View the latest account status, code hash, and recent messages.

#### Syntax
Not runnable

```bash
vas <account-addr|bookmark>
```

<ACCOUNT_ADDR_OR_BOOKMARK> — TON address in base64 or a saved bookmark name; <LIMIT> — number of messages to show; <BOOKMARK_NAME> — local alias for an address.

#### Behavior

- Resolves bookmarks automatically and fetches the account via lite-client.
- Prints a status table (address, state, balance, detected contract version), the raw code hash, and the last 10 inbound/outbound messages with relative timestamps.
- Useful for verifying that deployments succeeded or funds arrived.

#### Example

```bash
vas EQBf...nw
```
Values shown with ellipses are shortened for brevity.

### `vah`

#### Purpose
Print a paginated message history for an account.

#### Syntax
Not runnable

```bash
vah <account-addr|bookmark> <limit>
```

#### Behavior

- Shows the most recent `<LIMIT>` messages, marking direction (`>>>` for outgoing, `<<<` for incoming), amount, and counterparty addresses in base64.
- Useful when you need deeper history than the default `vas` preview.

#### Example

```bash
vah EQBf...nw 25
```

## Bookmark management

### `nb`

#### Purpose
Create a bookmark for frequently used addresses.

#### Syntax
Not runnable

```bash
nb <bookmark-name> <account-addr>
```

#### Behavior

- Validates that `<ACCOUNT_ADDR>` is a correct TON address and stores it under `<BOOKMARK_NAME>` for future commands (for example, `mg` and `vas`).

#### Example

```bash
nb treasury EQBf...nw
```

### `bl`

#### Purpose
List all stored bookmarks.

#### Syntax

```bash
bl
```

#### Behavior

- Prints a table with each bookmark name, address, and any cached metadata (balance or expiration date if available).

### `db`

#### Purpose
Delete a bookmark by name.

#### Syntax
Not runnable

```bash
db <bookmark-name>
```

#### Behavior

- Removes the bookmark from MyTonCtrl storage. Future commands must use the raw address unless you recreate the bookmark.

#### Example

```bash
db treasury
```

## Governance and configuration helpers

### `ol`

#### Purpose
Display open governance offers (configuration proposals).

#### Syntax
Not runnable

```bash
ol [--json] [hash]
```

#### Behavior

- Without flags, prints a table showing hash (trimmed unless you pass the literal `hash` argument), config ID, votes, win/loss tally, approval percentage, and pass status.
- `--json` outputs the raw offer list in JSON format.

#### Examples

```bash
ol
ol --json
ol hash
```

### `od`

#### Purpose
Diff a proposal’s configuration against the current config.

#### Syntax
Not runnable

```bash
od <offer-hash>
```

#### Behavior

- Fetches the offer, runs lite-client commands to dump the proposed config, and shows a `diff` between the current value and the proposal. Requires shell `diff` utility.

#### Example

```bash
od xKF+2Cj4wP6w2y...
```

### `cl`

#### Purpose
List validator complaints for the current or previous round.

#### Syntax
Not runnable

```bash
cl [past] [--json] [adnl]
```

#### Behavior

- With no flags, prints complaint entries with election ID, validator Abstract Datagram Network Layer (ADNL) address (trimmed unless `adnl` is supplied), fine, vote count, approval percentage, and pass status (color-coded with textual status labels).
- `past` switches to the previous election round; `--json` dumps raw data.

#### Examples

```bash
cl
cl past adnl
cl --json
```

## Election data

### `el`

#### Purpose
Inspect election entries submitted by validators.

#### Syntax
Not runnable

```bash
el [past] [--json] [adnl] [pubkey] [wallet]
```

#### Behavior

- The default view shows trimmed ADNL/pubkey/wallet values along with stake and max-factor.
- Add `past` to see the previous round, `--json` for raw output, or the literals `adnl`, `pubkey`, `wallet` to disable trimming for those columns.

#### Examples

```bash
el
el past adnl pubkey
el --json
```

## Validator roster

### `vl`

#### Purpose
Print the validator list with optional filters and formats.

#### Syntax
Not runnable

```bash
vl [past] [fast] [--json] [adnl] [pubkey] [wallet] [offline]
```

#### Behavior

- Default view shows index, trimmed ADNL/pubkey/wallet, stake, efficiency, and online status (color-coded with textual status labels).
- `past` loads the previous round; `fast` avoids extra lite-client calls for performance.
- `--json` returns raw data. Passing `adnl`, `pubkey`, or `wallet` prevents trimming for those columns. `offline` filters to entries marked offline.

#### Examples

```bash
vl
vl fast offline
vl past --json adnl
```

## Pool diagnostics

### `get_pool_data`

#### Purpose
Retrieve detailed pool contract data by name or address.

#### Syntax
Not runnable

```bash
get_pool_data <pool-name|pool-addr>
```

#### Behavior

- Accepts either a local pool alias (resolved via stored `.addr` file) or a base64 (bounceable) address.
- Prints the JSON returned by `runmethodfull get_pool_data` (arguments omitted), including stake, Elector values, and state flags.

#### Example

```bash
get_pool_data mypool
```
