A trace is a set of messages and transactions produced by a single external message.

Each _i-th_ transaction in the trace is triggered by a message sent during the action phase of some earlier _j-th_ transaction, where _j < i_.

All messages and transactions in the trace are ordered by their [logical time (lt)](/ton/tblkch#1-4-1-logical-time), reflecting their logical dependencies. The diagram shows transactions on independent accounts, each triggered by an incoming message, with `lt` values indicated for every message.

<Aside type={"note"}>
  Transactions may be triggered not only by external messages but also by tick-tock events, commonly used within internal TON blockchain contracts, such as governance or elector contracts.

## Using traces in Tonviewer

In [Tonviewer](https://tonviewer.com/), traces are visualized as **directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)**, where _transactions are nodes_ and _messages are edges_, showing the full sequence of account state changes triggered by a single external message.

### Tracing operations

Traces offer **a high-level** view of an operation, illustrating how multiple transactions and messages interact to produce the final result. Within the graph, related transactions are grouped into human-readable actions, _providing developers with both the low-level transaction flow and the corresponding higher-level operations_.

**Example**

The NFT transfer illustrates a single operation that consists of **three transactions**, each triggered by messages. To learn how to read traces, follow [this article](/ecosystem/explorers/tonviewer#steps-to-analyze-an-operation).

## High-level access using API

To fetch transaction data, use the high-level [`GET /traces`](/api-reference/actions/get-traces) endpoint.
This method allows you to retrieve all related transactions for a given operation, without parsing individual transactions.
