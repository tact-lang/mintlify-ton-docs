## Wallet setup

We demonstrate wallet setup using the **web version** of [wallet.ton.org](https://wallet.ton.org/).
This allows developers to complete all steps on a single device without switching platforms.

1. Open [wallet.ton.org](https://wallet.ton.org/).
2. Click **Create Wallet** to create a new wallet.

3. Next, choose how to protect your wallet — there are two options:
  - **Connect Biometrics** — create a passkey when prompted by _Chrome_.

A pop-up window will appear showing available storage options for your passkey.
Please select _the most convenient_ location to store it **securely**.

### Interface overview

The main screen of the wallet displays essential account information and actions.

- **Account balance (yellow box)** displays the total amount of Toncoin and other tokens held on your account.
- **Account address (red box)** is your unique account identifier, shown both as a QR code and as a base64-encoded string.

For example: `UQDDKXleckOm6CTbab3CPz0TkvbSkrlUFum_YMIa-IIfGmXk`.
You can share this address to receive TON, jettons, or NFTs.
- The **send button (green box)** opens the transfer form, allowing you to send TON or jettons to another account address.

### Testnet

wallet.ton.org requires an existing **Mainnet wallet** before you can create a **Testnet account**.
The Testnet account is derived from your Mainnet wallet’s mnemonic.

To add a Testnet account:

1. Click the **Settings** icon.

<Image

  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/settings_dark.png"
  alt="Settings button"
/>

2. In the settings window, **double-click** the wallet version number to open developer options.

<Image
  src="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/version_light.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/version_dark.png"
  alt="Click on version"
/>

3. In the **Developer options** panel, locate the **Networks** section and select **Testnet**.

<Image
  src="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/testnet_light.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/testnet_dark.png"
  alt="Choose Testnet"
/>

4. The app automatically returns to the main screen, where the interface indicates that you’re now using **the Testnet version**.

<Aside type="note">
  Mainnet and Testnet use different address formats — your Testnet address will not be identical to your Mainnet address.
  See [How to read and write TON addresses](/ton/addresses/writing-and-reading-addresses#using-online-converter) for details on address formats and conversion.

## Deploy a wallet

A wallet must be **deployed** before use — its account state must be **active**.

Newly created wallets have the default state **nonexistent**, meaning the account has _no code, data, or balance_.

### Check the account state

Use a [blockchain explorer](/ecosystem/explorers/overview) to inspect the account. For **Testnet**, use [Tonviewer Testnet](https://testnet.tonviewer.com/).

1. Paste your address into the search bar.

<Image
  src="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/tonviewer_light.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/tonviewer_dark.png"
  alt="Insert your address in Tonviewer search"
/>

2. The account details will appear. In a newly created wallet, the status is **nonexist**, indicating the wallet is not deployed.

<Image
  src="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/address_nonexist_light.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/address_nonexist_dark.png"
  alt="Account status: nonexist"
/>

### Fund the wallet

A wallet must receive funds before deployment.
- On Testnet, request free Testnet Toncoins from the [TON Testnet Faucet](link).

After receiving funds, the wallet enters the **uninit** state. This means the account has a balance, but the smart contract is not yet deployed.

  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/address_uninit_dark.png"
  alt="Account status: uninit"
/>

### Send the first transaction

With TON in the account, the wallet can be deployed. Deployment occurs when _the wallet processes its first transaction_.

In this example, we send TON to the account itself on Testnet to observe the transaction and wallet deployment on-chain.

To send TON to your own account:

1. Click **Send**, enter your wallet address in **Recipient Address**, and the **Amount** of TON. Optionally, add a comment. Click **Send TON**.

  src="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/send_coins_light.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/send_coins_dark.png"
  alt="Sending coins"
/>

2. In the confirmation popup, verify the transaction details and click **Confirm** if correct; otherwise, **Edit**.

<Image
  src="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/confirm_light.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/confirm_dark.png"
  alt="Confirm transaction"
/>

3. After confirmation, the wallet will display a notification: **Coins have been sent!**

<Image
  src="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/notification_light.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/notification_dark.png"
  alt="Notification"
/>

Next, check your wallet status in the blockchain explorer.

The wallet should appear as **active**. _Congratulations, you have successfully deployed your contract!_

<Image
  src="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/active_light.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/active_dark.png"
  alt="Account status: active"
/>

You will also see a **Contract Type** field. To learn more about contract types, see [Wallets history](/standard/wallets/history).
