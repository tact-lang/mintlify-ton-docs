See [Account statuses](../../ton/statuses) as needed.

TON wallets work with [address formats](../../ton/addresses/address-formats) as follows:

## Receiving

- Wallets display the user's address in a user-friendly bounceable or non-bounceable form.

## Sending

1. A user sends a message with funds and optionally a comment to the destination's wallet address in one of the user-friendly formats through the wallet app.

1. The wallet app checks the validity of the destination address representation: its length, valid characters, prefix, and checksum. If the address is not valid, the wallet app shows an alert and does not send.

1. If the address has a [Testnet-only flag](../../ton/addresses/address-formats#flag-definitions) and the wallet app works on Mainnet, then the wallet app shows an alert and does not send.

1. The wallet app retrieves the bounceable flag from the address.

1. The wallet app checks the destination address. If it has `uninit` status, the app forces the `bounce` field of the sending message to `false` and ignores the bounceable/non-bounceable flag in the address representation.

1. If the destination is not `uninit`, then the wallet app uses the bounceable/non-bounceable flag from the address representation for the `bounce` field of the sending message.
