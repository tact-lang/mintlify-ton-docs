2. Select **Create new wallet**
3. Set a PIN code for transaction confirmation

### For Testnet

Tonkeeper requires a mainnet wallet before creating a testnet account. The testnet account derives from your existing wallet's [mnemonic](link-to-mnemonic-article).

To add a testnet account:

1. From the main screen, tap your **wallet name**
2. Select **Add Wallet → Testnet Account**
3. Enter your 24-word mnemonic

## Deploy wallet

Before you can use your wallet on-chain to send transactions or interact with smart contracts, you need to deploy it.

To deploy your wallet, you need TON. For testnet, you can request free coins from the [TON testnet faucet](link-to-testnet-coins-guide).

Once you have coins in your wallet:

1. Open Tonkeeper and tap **Send**
2. Enter a recipient address (for testing, you may send to yourself)
3. Specify the amount
4. Confirm the transaction with your PIN

Your wallet is now deployed and active on-chain.

## Transfer NFTs

To send an NFT to another person:

1. In Tonkeeper, go to the **Collectibles** tab
2. Browse your collection and choose the specific NFT you want to send, then tap **Transfer**
3. Enter the recipient's wallet address or domain (like TON DNS), write a comment if needed, and tap **Continue**
4. Follow the prompts to confirm the transaction

Always double-check all the transaction information. Once the transaction is complete, you cannot undo it. Once confirmed, the NFT will be transferred to the recipient's wallet.
