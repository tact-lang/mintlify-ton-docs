## Create a wallet

You need to first install Tonkeeper using any of the methods above. For the steps below, we’ll use the mobile version as it’s convenient to set up. Once installed:

1. Open Tonkeeper.
2. Click **Create new wallet**.

3. Customize your wallet by adding your wallet name. Add a name or icon if desired.

height = "400"
width = "400"
alt="Customize wallet"
/>

4. Set a PIN code for transaction confirmation. Your TON wallet will be created but we are not done yet.

darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/tonkeeper/tonkeeper-dark.jpeg"
height = "400"
width = "400"
alt="Tonkeeper wallet created screen"
/>

5. Click **Back up your recovery phrase**. Without it, you cannot restore access to your wallet.

height = "400"
width = "400"
alt="Backup recovery phrase"
/>

6. Click **Back up manually**. You'll see an attention dialog box (*read this carefully as it contains dos and don'ts you need to know before viewing your recovery phrase*). Once you're done, click continue.

height = "400"
width = "400"
alt="Manual backup screen"
/>

7. Write down the 24 recovery phrases shown to you as this is very important. Click check backup once you're done. 

<Aside type="caution">
Never share your recovery phrase with anyone. If someone gets access to your 24-word recovery phrase, they can have access to all your funds.
</Aside>

8. You'll be asked to verify a few words to confirm if you have saved your recovery phrase correctly. After verification, click **Done**.

alt="Backup complete screen"
/>

9. You can always back up your recovery phrase whenever you choose.

alt="Backup complete screen"
/>

**That's it!** _Your wallet is now ready to use_.

## Testnet accounts

Tonkeeper requires an existing Mainnet wallet before you can create a Testnet account. The Testnet account is derived from your Mainnet wallet's mnemonic.

To add a Testnet account:

1. Click on your wallet name at the top of the screen and click **Add wallet**.

<Image

darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/tonkeeper/add-wallet-dark.jpeg"
height = "400"
width = "400"
alt="Add wallet screen"
/>

2. Select **Testnet account** from the list.

darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/tonkeeper/testnet-dark.jpeg"
height = "400"
width = "400"
alt="Select Testnet account screen"
/>

3. Enter your 24‑word recovery phrase given to you when you created the wallet and tap **Continue**. 

4. You can add a custom name or icon for your Testnet wallet.

<Image

darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/tonkeeper/customize-wallet-dark.jpeg"
height = "400"
width = "400"
alt="Customize wallet screen"
/>

5. Enter your passcode to confirm and your Testnet wallet will be created.

**All set!** You now have both mainnet and testnet wallet set up.

<Note>Mainnet and Testnet use different address formats, your Testnet address will not be identical to your Mainnet address. See [How to read and write TON addresses](https://companyname-a7d5b98e-wallet-ton-org.mintlify.app/ton/addresses/writing-and-reading-addresses#using-online-converter) for details on address formats and conversion.</Note>

## Deploy a wallet

Before you can use your wallet, it must be **deployed** — the account state needs to become **active**.

When you first create a wallet, it starts in the **nonexist** state, meaning there’s _no code, data, or balance_ stored on-chain yet.

### Check your account state

You can use the [TON blockchain explorer](/ecosystem/explorers/overview) to check your account status. For **Testnet**, use [Tonviewer Testnet](https://testnet.tonviewer.com/).

1. Paste your wallet address into the search bar.

<Image
  src="/resources/images/wallets/tonkeeper/tonviewer-light.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/tonkeeper/tonviewer-dark.png"
  alt="Insert your address in Tonviewer search"
/>

2. Your account details will show up. For a newly created wallet, you'll see the status as **nonexist**, which means your wallet isn't deployed yet.

<Image
  src="/resources/images/wallets/tonkeeper/address-nonexist-light.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/tonkeeper/address-nonexist-dark.png"
  alt="Account status - nonexist"
/>

### Fund your wallet

Your wallet needs to receive funds before it can be deployed.

On Testnet, you can get free Testnet Toncoins from the [TON Testnet Faucet](add-link-once-page-is-merged).

Once you receive funds, your wallet moves to the **uninit** state. This means your account has a balance, but the smart contract isn't deployed yet.

<Image
  src="/resources/images/wallets/tonkeeper/address-uninit-light.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/tonkeeper/address-uninit-dark.png"
  alt="Account status - uninit"
/>

### Send your first transaction

Now that you have TON in your account, you can deploy the wallet. Deployment happens when _your wallet processes its first transaction_.

For this example, we'll send TON to your own account on Testnet so you can see the transaction and wallet deployment happen on-chain.

To send TON to your own account:

1. Click **Send**.
2. Enter your own wallet address as the recipient, the amount you want to send and click **Continue**.

<Image
  src="/resources/images/wallets/tonkeeper/send-transaction-light.jpeg"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/tonkeeper/send-transaction-dark.jpeg"
  height = "400"
  width = "400"
  alt="Send transaction"
/>

4. Review the transaction details and click **Confirm**.

<Image
  src="/resources/images/wallets/tonkeeper/confirm-transaction-light.jpeg"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/tonkeeper/confirm-transaction-dark.jpeg"
  height = "400"
  width = "400"
  alt="Account status: uninit"
/>

5. Enter your PIN to approve the transanction request. You'll see a confirmation screen once the transaction is sent.

Next, check your wallet status in the blockchain explorer — if it’s active, _you’ve successfully deployed your contract!_

<Image
  src="/resources/images/wallets/tonkeeper/active-light.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/tonkeeper/active-dark.png"
  alt="Account status: uninit"
/>

You'll also see other fields like your address, current TON balance, and your contract type showing your current wallet version, in this case its the w5. To learn more about wallet contract types, see the [Wallets history](/standard/wallets/overview).

## Transfer jettons

Jettons are tokens on the TON blockchain (similar to ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum). Once your wallet is deployed and active, you can send jettons to other addresses.

To send jettons:

1. From the **Wallet** tab, click the jetton you want to send.

<Image

darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/tonkeeper/token-detail-dark.jpeg"
height = "400"
width = "400"
alt="Token detail screen"
/>

2. Click on *Send** and enter the recipient's wallet address, amount you want to send and add a comment (optional). Click **Continue** to proceed.

<Aside type="note">
Transaction fees are always paid in TON, even when sending other tokens. Make sure you have enough TON in your wallet to cover the fee.
</Aside>

height = "400"
width = "400"
alt="Send jetton screen"
/>

3. Next, review the transaction details and click **Confirm** to send.

alt="Confirm jetton transfer"
/>

4. Enter your PIN or use biometric authentication to approve the transfer.

You can verify the jetton transfer using the [Tonviewer Testnet](https://testnet.tonviewer.com/). Paste your wallet address into the search bar to see all your transactions.


## Transfer NFTs

NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are unique digital collectibles. Tonkeeper lets you view and transfer NFTs directly from the wallet.

To transfer an NFT:

1. Navigate to the **Collectibles** tab at the bottom of the screen.

2. Click the NFT you want to transfer and click on **Transfer**.

5. Enter your PIN or use biometric authentication to approve the transfer.

Once transferred, the NFT will be sent to the recipient. You can verify the nft transfer using the [Tonviewer Testnet](https://testnet.tonviewer.com/). Paste your wallet address into the search bar to see all your transactions.
