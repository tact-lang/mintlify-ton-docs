## Create a wallet

You need to first install Tonkeeper using any of the methods above. For the steps below, we’ll use the mobile version as it’s convenient to set up. Once installed:

1. Open Tonkeeper.
2. Click **Create new wallet**.

4. Set a PIN code for transaction confirmation. Your TON wallet will be created but we are not done yet.

6. Click **Back up manually**. You'll see an attention dialog box (*read this carefully as it contains dos and don'ts you need to know before viewing your recovery phrase*). Once you're done, click continue.

7. Write down the 24 recovery phrases shown to you as this is very important. Click check backup once you're done. 

<Warning>Never share your recovery phrase with anyone. If someone gets access to your 24-word recovery phrase, they can have access to all your funds.</Warning>

8. You'll be asked to verify a few words to confirm if you have saved your recovery phrase correctly. After verification, click **Done**.

**That's it!** _Your wallet is now ready to use_.

## Testnet accounts

Tonkeeper requires an existing Mainnet wallet before you can create a Testnet account. The Testnet account is derived from your Mainnet wallet's mnemonic.

To add a Testnet account:

1. Click on your wallet name at the top of the screen and click **Add wallet**.

2. Select **Testnet account** from the list.

height="65%"
alt="Select Testnet account screen"

3. Enter your 24‑word recovery phrase given to you when you created the wallet and tap **Continue**. 

4. You can add a custom name or icon for your Testnet wallet.

5. Enter your passcode to confirm and your Testnet wallet will be created.

**All set!** You now have both mainnet and testnet wallet set up.

<Note>Mainnet and Testnet use different address formats, your Testnet address will not be identical to your Mainnet address. See [How to read and write TON addresses](https://companyname-a7d5b98e-wallet-ton-org.mintlify.app/ton/addresses/writing-and-reading-addresses#using-online-converter) for details on address formats and conversion.</Note>

## Deploy a wallet

Before you can use your wallet, it must be **deployed** — the account state needs to become **active**.

When you first create a wallet, it starts in the **nonexist** state, meaning there’s _no code, data, or balance_ stored on-chain yet.

### Check your account state

You can use the [TON blockchain explorer](/ecosystem/explorers/overview) to check your account status. For **Testnet**, use [Tonviewer Testnet](https://testnet.tonviewer.com/).

1. Paste your wallet address into the search bar.

<Image
  src="/resources/images/wallets/tonkeeper/tonviewer-light.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/tonkeeper/tonviewer-dark.png"
  alt="Insert your address in Tonviewer search"
/>

2. Your account details will show up. For a newly created wallet, you'll see the status as **nonexist**, which means your wallet isn't deployed yet.

<Image
  src="/resources/images/wallets/tonkeeper/address-nonexist-light.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/tonkeeper/address-nonexist-dark.png"
  alt="Account status - nonexist"
/>

### Fund your wallet

Your wallet needs to receive funds before it can be deployed.

On Testnet, you can get free Testnet Toncoins from the [TON Testnet Faucet](link).

Once you receive funds, your wallet moves to the **uninit** state. This means your account has a balance, but the smart contract isn't deployed yet.

  src="/resources/images/wallets/tonkeeper/address-uninit-light.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/tonkeeper/address-uninit-dark.png"
  alt="Account status - uninit"
/>

### Send your first transaction

Now that you have TON in your account, you can deploy the wallet. Deployment happens when _your wallet processes its first transaction_.

For this example, we'll send TON to your own account on Testnet so you can see the transaction and wallet deployment happen on-chain.

To send TON to your own account:

1. Click **Send**.
2. Enter your own wallet address as the recipient.
3. Enter the amount you want to send and click **Continue**.

<Image
  src="/resources/images/wallets/tonkeeper/send-transaction-light.jpeg"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/tonkeeper/send-transaction-dark.jpeg"
  alt="Send transaction"
/>

4. Review the transaction details and click **Confirm**.

<Image
  src="/resources/images/wallets/tonkeeper/confirm-transaction-light.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/tonkeeper/confirm-transaction-dark.png"
  alt="Account status: uninit"
/>

5. Enter your PIN to approve the transanction request. You'll see a confirmation screen once the transaction is sent.

Next, check your wallet status in the blockchain explorer — if it’s active, _you’ve successfully deployed your contract!_
<Image
  src="/resources/images/wallets/tonkeeper/active-light.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/tonkeeper/active-dark.png"
  alt="Account status: uninit"
/>

You'll also see other fields like your address, current TON balance, and contract type showing your wallet version. To learn more about wallet contract types, see the [Wallets history](/standard/wallets/overview).
