## How to create wallet on Mainnet

When you first open Tonkeeper, you'll see two options: **Create new wallet** and **Import existing wallet**.

Choose **Create new wallet** and follow these steps:

1. Set a PIN code. It will be used to confirm transactions and other important actions
2. Add a name for your wallet
3. Finish the setup by backing up your recovery phrase (also known as the seed phrase), and your wallet is ready to use!

<Tip> The recovery phrase is the only way to restore access to your wallet if the app is deleted or your device is lost. Make sure to save it in a secure place. </Tip>

## Switching to a Testnet account

Before using a wallet on the testnet, you need to create it on the [mainnet](/#how-to-create-wallet-on-mainnet) first.

Then, from main screen, tap your **wallet name → Add Wallet → Testnet Account**  and enter the 24 secret words of your wallet.

## How to receive testnet coins (TON)?
You can get free test coins from the [@testgiver_ton_bot](https://t.me/testgiver_ton_bot) on Telegram.
Once you open the bot, paste your testnet wallet address. The bot will send 2 TON to your address.
You can only request once per hour. 

## Can I transfer TON from the testnet to the mainnet?
No, it's not possible to transfer TON or tokens between testnet and mainnet. The testnet and mainnet are separate, parallel blockchains. They operate independently, so transfers between them cannot be made.
