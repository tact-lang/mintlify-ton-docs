## Create a wallet

To create a new wallet:

1. Open Tonkeeper
2. Select **Create new wallet**
3. Set a PIN code for transaction confirmation
4. Add a name for your wallet
5. Back up your recovery phrase (24-word mnemonic)

<Tip>The recovery phrase is the only way to restore access to your wallet if the app is deleted or your device is lost. Make sure to save it in a secure place.</Tip>

### For Testnet

Tonkeeper requires a mainnet wallet before creating a testnet account. This is because the testnet account derives from your existing wallet's mnemonic.

To add a testnet account:

1. From the main screen, tap your **wallet name**
2. Select **Add Wallet â†’ Testnet Account**
3. Enter your 24-word mnemonic

## Transfer coins

To send or transfer coins from your wallet to another address, you need to first have coins. For testing purposes, see [How to get testnet coins](link-to-testnet-coins-guide).

Once you have coins:

1. Open Tonkeeper
2. Select the asset you want to send
3. Tap **Send**
4. Enter the recipient's address
5. Specify the amount
6. Confirm the transaction with your PIN

<Warning>Testnet and mainnet are separate blockchains. Transfers between them are not possible.</Warning>
