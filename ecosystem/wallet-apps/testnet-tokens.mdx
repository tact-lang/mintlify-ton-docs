TON testnet tokens are free test coins used for development and testing on the TON testnet network. They have no real value and are used instead of spending real TON.

## Get tokens from the testnet faucet bot

The TON testnet faucet is a TON Telegram bot that dispenses free test TON tokens.

To request testnet tokens:

1. Open [@testgiver_ton_bot](https://t.me/testgiver_ton_bot) in Telegram
2. Start the bot by sending the `/start` command
3. Tap the **Get 2 TON in testnet** button (or send the `/get` command)
4. Complete the captcha that appears
5. Provide your wallet address when prompted
6. The bot will send 2 testnet TON to your address

<Note>You can request test TON once every hour.</Note>

To interact with the bot at any time use the `/menu` command to view options, or send `/get` to quickly request more tokens.

## Verify the tokens

After requesting tokens, wait a few seconds for the transaction to complete. Then, check your wallet balance to confirm you received the testnet TON. You can also verify the transaction on the [Testnet explorer](https://testnet.tonscan.org/).
