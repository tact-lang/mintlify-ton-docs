TON testnet tokens are free test coins you can use for development and testing on the TON testnet network. They let you experiment and build without spending actual Toncoin.

## Get tokens from the testnet faucet bot

The TON testnet faucet is a Telegram bot that dispenses free test Toncoins to users, allowing them to experiment on testnet.

To request testnet tokens:

1. Open [@testgiver\_ton\_bot](https://t.me/testgiver_ton_bot) in Telegram. You'll see a prompt asking if you want to open Telegram. Click **Open Telegram**.

**That's it!** Wait a few seconds and the testnet TON will appear in your wallet.

<Note>You can request test TON once every hour.</Note>

## Check your balance

After requesting tokens, refresh your wallet to see the updated balance, or verify the transaction on [Tonviewer Testnet](https://testnet.tonviewer.com/).

1. Open Tonviewer Testnet and paste your wallet address in the search bar.

2. You'll see your wallet details including your balance and transaction history showing the testnet TON you received. Your wallet has now moved from **nonexist** to **uninit** state since it received funds.
