TON testnet tokens are free test coins that can be used for development and testing before going live.

There are two ways to get testnet tokens:

## Option 1: Get free tokens from the Testgiver TON Bot (2 TON/hour)

The Testgiver TON Bot is testnet faucet bot that gives you 2 free test Toncoin per hour. Itâ€™s the easiest way to fund your test wallet for development.

To request testnet tokens:

1. Open [@testgiver\_ton\_bot](https://t.me/testgiver_ton_bot) in your browser. You'll see a prompt asking if you want to open Telegram. Click **Open Telegram** or **START BOT**.

/>

2. Once the bot opens, you'll see the bot info. Click **START** to begin.

3. The bot will welcome you and you have two ways to request TON:

- You can directly click the **Get 2 TON in testnet** button.

Either option will take you to the next step.

4. You'll be asked to complete a captcha. Click on the captcha image to open it in full size, then carefully enter the characters you see.

  alt="Captcha screen"

5. Once the captcha is complete, enter your testnet wallet address.

<Aside type="caution">
Double-check that you're pasting your testnet wallet address. Mainnet and testnet addresses are different. See [How to read and write TON addresses](/ton/addresses/writing-and-reading-addresses#how-to-read-and-write-ton-addresses).

  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/fund-wallet/enter-address-dark.png"
  alt="Enter wallet address"
/>

6. Once you submit your address, you'll see a confirmation message that your request has been added to the queue.

  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/fund-wallet/request-confirmed-dark.png"
  alt="Request confirmed"
/>

**That's it!** The bot will process the request and send you 2 test Toncoin.                                              

<Aside type="note">You can request test TON once every hour. If you need more tokens, just wait and request again.</Aside>

## Verify your balance

After requesting tokens, refresh your wallet to see the updated balance.

alt="Wallet showing testnet balance"
/>

Or verify the transaction using the Tonviewer Testnet explorer.

1. Open [Tonviewer Testnet](https://testnet.tonviewer.com/), paste your wallet address in the search bar and Click **Find**.

  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/fund-wallet/tonviewer-dark.png"
  alt="Tonviewer search"
/>

2. You'll see your wallet details including your current balance and transaction history showing the testnet TON you received from the bot. Your wallet state will also show **uninit**, which means your wallet has received funds but hasn't been deployed yet.

  alt="Wallet balance showing uninit state"
/>

**All done!** You now have testnet TON in your wallet and can start building and testing without any cost.

## Option 2: Request larger amounts (up to 5,000 TON)

This option is ideal for projects with extensive testing needs that require more capacity than the standard 2 TON per hour. 

You can request up to 5,000 testnet TON by filling out the [token request form](https://builders.ton.org/profile/projects/new?applicationSlug=testnet-form). 

The form will be reviewed by the TON Foundation and the tokens will be sent directly to your testnet wallet address.
