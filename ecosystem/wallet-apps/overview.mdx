**TODO: add links**

This article provides an overview of wallet applications built on the standard [wallet contract](/standard/wallets/how-it-works), describing their _operation, creation, transaction handling, and classification_.

## How wallet apps work

This section explains how wallet applications manage keys, initialize accounts, and process transactions on TON.

### Mnemonic decoding

A **mnemonic (seed phrase)** is a human-readable sequence of typically 24 words. It encodes the information needed to generate a **key pair**, consisting of a private key and a public key.
- The **private key** is used to sign messages and authorize transactions.
- The **public key** is stored in the wallet’s smart contract and is used to verify signatures of incoming messages.

A mnemonic allows a user to **recover** their wallet and key pair on the same wallet app or compatible implementations.
Users are fully responsible for securely storing their mnemonic, as loss results in permanent loss of access.

### Account initialization

A wallet account begins in the [nonexist state](/ton/statuses#status-variety), which is the default for accounts with no transaction history, code, data, or balance. At this stage, the account does not exist on-chain. However, its **wallet address** can already be computed from the wallet’s **TODO**. This address can be used to receive funds even before the wallet is initialized.

After receiving coins, the account transitions to the [uninit state](/ton/statuses#status-variety). In this state, it holds a balance and metadata but cannot execute transactions or process messages.

The initialization process then proceeds as follows:
- Deploying the wallet contract — the wallet’s smart contract is deployed, initializing its code and persistent data.

### First transaction

A wallet becomes **active** upon executing its first transaction.
This initial transaction completes the wallet’s activation, enabling it to interact with the blockchain.
In the [active state](/ton/statuses#status-variety), the wallet:
- Contains deployed contract code and persistent data.
- Holds a balance and can process incoming and outgoing messages.
- It is capable of signing and sending further transactions using its private key.

### Transaction process

A wallet transaction is initiated by creating an **external message** signed with the wallet’s private key. The wallet contract uses the corresponding public key to verify the signature.

Key steps:
- Message creation — specify recipient, amount, and optional payload (e.g., smart contract call).
- Signing — the wallet signs the message with its private key.
- Sequence number (seqno) — ensures uniqueness and prevents replay attacks.
- Submission — the signed message is sent to the blockchain network.
- Processing — validators verify the signature, apply fees, and update the account's balance and state.

Each processed transaction increments the wallet's seqno and updates its state. Transactions can carry Toncoin or other supported assets and interact with other smart contracts.

## Wallet types

Wallets are classified by how they manage private keys, store them, and their intended usage.

### Custodial and non-custodial

Wallets are defined by _how private keys are managed_.

- **Custodial wallets** store private keys with a third party, such as an exchange or service provider. The custodian manages security and may provide account recovery. However, users must trust the custodian with full access to their assets.
- **Non-custodial or self-custody wallets** store private keys only with the user. Keys are protected with a **seed phrase** — a sequence of 24 words generated at wallet creation. This gives the user _complete ownership_ and _control over their data_. However, full responsibility also applies: losing the seed phrase means permanent loss of access.

### Hardware and software

The storage of private keys defines wallet types — _online (hot) or offline (cold)_.

- **Hardware (cold) wallets** are physical devices that keep private keys offline, isolated from internet exposure. When authorizing a transaction, the device signs it internally, ensuring that private keys remain on the device.
- **Software (hot) wallets** run on devices such as smartphones or computers. Private keys are stored in the device’s secure storage, making them readily available for transactions but also exposed to online risks. Software wallets include **mobile**, **web**, and **desktop** applications.


### Developer and user

Wallets differ by their intended use.

- **User wallets** are designed for everyday operations, including storing, sending, and receiving Toncoin or tokens, as well as interacting with applications. Their design emphasizes usability and accessibility.
- **Developer wallets** are designed for testing and development purposes. They are typically used with Testnet, SDKs, or command-line tools to deploy contracts, generate keys, and send transactions in controlled environments.
