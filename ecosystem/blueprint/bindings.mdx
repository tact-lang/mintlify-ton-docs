## Writing contract code

### Tolk
1. Implement the contract in `contracts/<CONTRACT>.tolk`; if you wish, split into multiple files
2. Implement wrapper TypeScript class in `wrappers/<CONTRACT>.ts` to encode messages and decode getters

### FunC
1. Implement the standalone FunC root contract in `contracts/<CONTRACT>.fc`
2. Implement shared FunC imports (if breaking code to multiple files) in `contracts/imports/*.fc`
3. Implement wrapper TypeScript class in `wrappers/<CONTRACT>.ts` to encode messages and decode getters

### Tact
1. Implement the contract in `contracts/<CONTRACT>.tact`
2. Wrappers will be automatically generated in `build/<CONTRACT>/tact_<CONTRACT>.ts`


## Publishing Wrapper Code

1. **Authenticate with npm**
Run `npm adduser` to log in to your npm account.
> 📝 **Note:** You can learn more about advanced authentication in the official npm docs:
> [npmrc – Auth-Related Configuration](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/npmrc#auth-related-configuration)

2. **Update the package version**
Edit the `version` field in your `package.json` to reflect the new release (e.g., `1.0.1` → `1.0.2`).

3. **Build the package**
Run the following command to generate and bundle your contract wrappers:

```bash
blueprint pack
```

4. **Publish to npm**
Push the package to the public npm registry:

```bash
npm publish --access public
```
