## Overview

* `contracts/` - Source code for all smart contracts and their imports
* `wrappers/` - TypeScript interface classes for all contracts **except Tact**.
* Tact-generated wrappers are located according to the build path defined in [`tact.config.json`](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/config/)
* Each wrapper implements `Contract` interface from [@ton/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ton/core)
* Includes message [de]serialization primitives, getter wrappers and compilation functions
* Used by the test suite and client code to interact with the contracts from TypeScript
* `compilables/` - Compilations scripts for contracts
* `tests/` - TypeScript test suite for all contracts (relying on [Sandbox](https://github.com/ton-org/sandbox) for in-process tests)
* `scripts/` - Deployment scripts to mainnet/testnet and other scripts interacting with live contracts
* `build/` - Compilation artifacts created here after running a build command


## Building contracts

1. You need a compilation script in `compilables/<CONTRACT>.compile.ts` - [example](/example/compilables/Counter.compile.ts)
2. Run interactive: &nbsp;&nbsp; `npx blueprint build` &nbsp; or &nbsp; `yarn blueprint build`
3. Non-interactive: &nbsp; `npx/yarn blueprint build <CONTRACT>` &nbsp; OR build all contracts &nbsp; `yarn blueprint build --all`
* Example: `yarn blueprint build counter`
4. Build results are generated in `build/<CONTRACT>.compiled.json`
5. Tact generated files are located in `build/<CONTRACT>` directory
6. Fift output is located in `build/<CONTRACT>/<CONTRACT>.fif`

## Running the test suites

1. Run in terminal: &nbsp; `npx blueprint test` &nbsp; or &nbsp; `yarn blueprint test`
2. Alternative method: &nbsp; `npm test` &nbsp; or &nbsp; `yarn test`
3. You can specify test file to run:  &nbsp; `npm/yarn test <CONTRACT>`
 * Example: `yarn test counter`
