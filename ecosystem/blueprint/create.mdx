* Example: `yarn blueprint create MyNewContract --type tolk-empty`

### Renaming contracts

1. Run interactive: &nbsp;&nbsp; `npx blueprint rename` &nbsp; or &nbsp; `yarn blueprint rename`
2. Non-interactive: &nbsp; `npx/yarn blueprint rename <OLD_NAME> <NEW_NAME>`
  * Example: `yarn blueprint rename OldContract NewContract `
