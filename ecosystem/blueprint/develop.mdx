title: "Smart contract development"
---

Ensure your current directory is the root of the project initialized with `npm create ton@latest`.

## Contract creation
Use Blueprint to create a new contract.

### Interactive mode

To launch a guided prompt to create a contract step by step, use:

```bash
npx/yarn blueprint create
```

### Non-interactive mode

To create a contract without prompts, provide the contract name and template type:

```bash
npx/yarn blueprint create <CONTRACT> --type <TYPE>
```
- `<CONTRACT>` — contract name
- `<TYPE>` — template type, e.g., tolk-empty, func-empty, tact-empty, tolk-counter, func-counter, tact-counter

**Example:**
```bash
yarn blueprint create MyNewContract --type tolk-empty
```

## Contract code writing

After creation, contracts are placed in the `contracts/` folder.
Each file uses the extension that matches its language.
For example, creating a Tolk contract `MyNewContract` results in `contracts/my_new_contract.tolk`.


## Building

Blueprint compiles your contracts into build artifacts.

### Interactive mode

Run without arguments to select contracts from a prompt:

```bash
npx/yarn blueprint build
```

### Non-interactive mode

Specify a contract name or use flags to skip prompts:

```bash
npx/yarn blueprint build <CONTRACT>
```

**Example:**
```bash
npx/yarn blueprint build MyNewContract
npx/yarn blueprint build --all # build all contracts
```

### Compiled artifacts

Compiled outputs are placed in the `build/` directory:

- `build/<CONTRACT>.compiled.json` - serialized contract representation used for deployment and testing.
- `build/<CONTRACT>/<CONTRACT>.fif`- Fift code derived from the contract.

## Deployment

To deploy contracts, follow the [Deployment and interaction](/ecosystem/blueprint/deploy).
