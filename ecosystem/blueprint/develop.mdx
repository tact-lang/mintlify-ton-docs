title: "Smart contract development"
---

Ensure your current directory is the root of the project initialized with `npm create ton@latest`.

## Contract creation
Use Blueprint to create a new contract.

### Interactive mode

To launch a guided prompt to create a contract step by step, use:

```bash
npx blueprint create
```

### Non-interactive mode

To create a contract without prompts, provide the contract name and template type:

```bash
npx blueprint create <CONTRACT> --type <TYPE>
```
- `<CONTRACT>`- contract name
- `<TYPE>`- template type, e.g., tolk-empty, func-empty, tact-empty, tolk-counter, func-counter, tact-counter

**Example:**
```bash
npx blueprint create MyNewContract --type tolk-empty
```

## Contract code writing

After creation, contracts are placed in the `contracts/` folder.
Each file uses the extension that matches its language.
For example, creating a Tolk contract `MyNewContract` results in `contracts/my_new_contract.tolk`.


## Building

Blueprint compiles your contracts into build artifacts.

### Interactive mode

Run without arguments to select contracts from a prompt:

```bash
npx blueprint build
```

### Non-interactive mode

Specify a contract name or use flags to skip prompts:

```bash
npx blueprint build <CONTRACT>
```

**Example:**
```bash
npx blueprint build MyNewContract
npx blueprint build --all # build all contracts
```

### Compiled artifacts

Compiled outputs are stored in the `build/` directory.

- `build/<CONTRACT>.compiled.json`- serialized contract representation used for deployment and testing.

    Each file contains three fields:

    - `hash` — hash of the compiled contract code in hexadecimal format.
    - `hashBase64`  — the same hash encoded in Base64.
    - `hex` — the compiled contract code in hexadecimal form.

    Example:

    ```json title='<CONTRACT>.compiled.json'
    {
        "hash":"21eabd3331276c532778ad3fdcb5b78e5cf2ffefbc0a6dc...",
        "hashBase64":"Ieq9MzEnbFMneK0/3LW3jlzy/++8Cm3Dxkt+I3yRe...",
        "hex":"b5ee9c72410106010082000114ff00f4a413f4bcf2c80b01..."
    }
    ```

- `build/<CONTRACT>/<CONTRACT>.fif` — Fift code derived from the contract.
