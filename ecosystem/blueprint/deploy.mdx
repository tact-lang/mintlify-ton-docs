## Running scripts

1. Custom scripts should be located in `scripts` folder
2. Script file must have exported function `run`
```ts
export async function run(provider: NetworkProvider, args: string[]) {
  //
}
```
3. Script can be run using `npx/yarn blueprint run <SCRIPT> [arg1, arg2, ...]` command

### Deploying contracts

TODO: example's link
1. You need a deployment script in `scripts/deploy<CONTRACT>.ts` - [example](/example/scripts/deployCounter.ts)
2. Run interactive: &nbsp;&nbsp; `npx blueprint run` &nbsp; or &nbsp; `yarn blueprint run`
3. Non-interactive: &nbsp; `npx/yarn blueprint run deploy<CONTRACT> --<NETWORK> --<DEPLOY_METHOD>`
  * Example: `yarn blueprint run deployCounter --mainnet --tonconnect`

### Using mnemonic provider

To run scripts using a wallet by mnemonic authentication, you need to configure your environment and use the `Mnemonic` option when running scripts.

Start by adding the following environment variables to your `.env` file:
* **`WALLET_MNEMONIC`** — Your wallet's mnemonic phrase (space-separated words).
* **`WALLET_VERSION`** — The wallet contract version to use. Supported versions: `v1r1`, `v1r2`, `v1r3`, `v2r1`, `v2r2`, `v3r1`, `v3r2`, `v4r1`, `v4r2` (or `v4`), `v5r1`.

**Optional variables:**
* **`WALLET_ID`** — The wallet ID (can be used with versions below `v5r1`).
* **`SUBWALLET_NUMBER`** — The subwallet number used to build the wallet ID (can be used with `v5r1` wallets).

Once your environment is set up, you can use the mnemonic wallet for deployment with the appropriate configuration.
