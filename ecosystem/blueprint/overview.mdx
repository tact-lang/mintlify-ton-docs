For smart contract development on TON Blockchain, **Blueprint** is an all-in-one development environment designed to enhance the process of creating, testing, and deploying smart contracts.

It includes:
- [Blueprint](https://github.com/ton-org/blueprint/blob/develop/README.md) — core tools for building contracts
- [Sandbox](https://github.com/ton-org/sandbox) — fast local testing in an isolated blockchain
- [Create TON App](https://github.com/ton-org/create-ton) — scaffolding a ready-to-use project
- [test-utils](https://github.com/ton-org/test-utils) - testing helpers and unit test matchers

This section covers development, testing, smart contracts deployment and interaction, performance benchmarks, and Blueprint configuration and reference.

## Quick start

To get started immediately, run the following command to create a new project and follow the on-screen instructions:

```console
npm create ton@latest
```

## Key features

- **Project scaffolding** - create a ready-to-use development environment with `npm create ton@latest`.
- **Streamlined workflow** - build, test, and deploy smart contracts efficiently.
- **Simple deployment** - publish contracts to Mainnet and Testnet directly from your wallet.
- **Fast local testing** - run multiple contracts in an isolated in-process blockchain.

## Tech stack

1. Compiling Tolk with https://github.com/ton-blockchain/tolk-js
2. Compiling FunC with https://github.com/ton-community/func-js
3. Compiling Tact with https://github.com/tact-lang/tact
4. Testing smart contracts with https://github.com/ton-org/sandbox
5. Deploying smart contracts with [TON Connect 2](https://github.com/ton-connect) or a `ton://` deeplink

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 22 or later
- Verify the version with `node -v`

## IDE plugins

- [JetBrains IDEs](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/23382-ton)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ton-core.vscode-ton)

## Environment setup

1. Run and follow the on-screen instructions: `npm/npx create ton@latest`.
2. From the project directory run `npm/yarn install` to install dependencies.

## Project structure

- `contracts/` - Source code for all smart contracts and their imports
- `scripts/` - Deployment scripts to mainnet/testnet and other scripts interacting with live contracts
- `tests/` - TypeScript test suite for all contracts (relying on [Sandbox](https://github.com/ton-org/sandbox) for in-process tests)
- `wrappers/` - TypeScript interface classes for all contracts **except Tact**.
    - Each wrapper implements `Contract` interface from [@ton/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ton/core)
    - Includes message [de]serialization primitives, getter wrappers and compilation functions
    - Used by the test suite and client code to interact with the contracts from TypeScript
- `build/` - Compilation artifacts created here after running a build command
