Blueprint is an all-in-one development environment designed to enhance the process of creating, testing, and deploying smart contracts on TON Blockchain using [Tolk](https://docs.ton.org/develop/tolk/overview), [FunC](https://docs.ton.org/develop/func/overview), and [Tact](https://docs.tact-lang.org/) languages.

### Quick start

Run the command in terminal to create a new project and follow the on-screen instructions:

```console
npm create ton@latest
```

### Core features

* Create a development environment from template - `npm create ton@latest`
* Streamlined workflow for building, testing and deploying smart contracts
* Dead simple deployment to mainnet/testnet using your favorite wallet (eg. Tonkeeper)
* Blazing fast testing of multiple smart contracts in an isolated blockchain running in-process

### Tech stack

1. Compiling Tolk with https://github.com/ton-blockchain/tolk-js
2. Compiling FunC with https://github.com/ton-community/func-js
3. Compiling Tact with https://github.com/tact-lang/tact
* Uses [`tact.config.json`](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/config/) as the build configuration file
4. Testing smart contracts with https://github.com/ton-org/sandbox
5. Deploying smart contracts with [TON Connect 2](https://github.com/ton-connect) or a `ton://` deeplink
