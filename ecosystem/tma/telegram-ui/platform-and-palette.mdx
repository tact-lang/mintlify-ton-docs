The `AppRoot` component implements a dynamic theming system within your application. It uses CSS variables and React context to adapt to various themes and platforms.

## CSS variables: the backbone of theming

The `AppRoot` theming system uses CSS variables to create a flexible styling framework. These variables fall into two categories: **basic variables** and **custom variables**. Both play a crucial role in tailoring the application's appearance to match Telegram's theme and any additional stylistic preferences.

### Basic variables

Basic variables inherit styles directly from Telegram or fall back on predefined styles within the library. This ensures that the application remains consistent with the user's current Telegram theme settings.

- **Telegram style inheritance**: When available, basic variables dynamically adopt values from Telegram's theme, aligning the application's appearance with the platform's chosen theme.
- **Library defaults**: In scenarios where Telegram theme data isn't available or is not supported in the current version, these variables revert to a set of default styles specified within the library, maintaining a coherent and user-friendly interface.

### Custom variables

Custom variables extend the theming capabilities, allowing for more nuanced and specific styling adjustments that go beyond the scope of Telegram's native themes.

- **Enhanced styling flexibility**: These variables enable the definition of unique stylistic elements like accent colors, providing opportunities for brand alignment and distinct visual design.
- **Brand identity support**: By using custom variables, developers can ensure that the application not only adheres to Telegram's theming but also reflects the brand's identity through consistent use of colors, typography, and other design elements.

## Internal mechanism for theme and platform adaptation

`AppRoot` uses React context and CSS variables to dynamically adjust the application's styling based on the current theme (light, dark, or Telegram custom themes) and platform (iOS, Android, and web):

- **Theme Detection and Application**: Upon initialization, `AppRoot` detects the current theme settings (from Telegram or manually set preferences) and updates the CSS variables accordingly. This process ensures that the theme is consistently applied across the application.
- **Platform-Specific Styling**: In addition to theme management, `AppRoot` also detects the user's platform and applies platform-specific styles to optimize the user experience. For example, adjustments to typography, element sizing, and interaction feedback align with platform conventions.
- **Contextual Theme and Platform Information**: Through the use of React context, `AppRoot` provides nested components with access to current theme and platform information. This allows for conditional rendering or styling adjustments deep within the component tree, based on the overall application context.

## Summary

The `AppRoot` theming system ensures visual consistency across themes and platforms. By combining CSS variables with React context, it offers a solution for managing theme and platform-specific styling, all while keeping the application aligned with Telegram's theming capabilities and the brand's visual identity.

`AppRoot` handles dynamic theming so you can focus on features.
