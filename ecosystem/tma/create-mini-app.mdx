## Overview

`@telegram-apps/create-mini-app` is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to scaffold your new
Mini App on the Telegram Mini Apps (TMA) platform. It generates a project with pre-configured libraries and template files,
allowing you to customize the content based on your specific requirements.

## Run the CLI

Run the following command:

```sh icon="npm"
npx @telegram-apps/telegram-apps-tools@latest
```

## Create a new application

The command runs a script that guides you through the creation of
your application by sequentially prompting for the following information:

## Set the project directory name

- Prompt: Enter the name of the directory where the project files will be located.
- Default: `mini-app`. The script creates a subdirectory with this name in the current directory.
