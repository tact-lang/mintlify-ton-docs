## Preparations

### Connect the TON Connect SDK

web3 events for the Telegram Mini Apps Analytics SDK are supported by the [`@tonconnect/ui`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tonconnect/ui) and [`@tonconnect/ui-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tonconnect/ui-react) libraries since version 2.0.3, [`@tonconnect/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tonconnect/sdk) since version 3.0.3.

[TON Connect overview](/ecosystem/ton-connect/index)

If your app doesn't use TON Connect, the analytics SDK still collects non-web3 events.

### Get the token with TON Builders

Register your project on [TON Builders](https://builders.ton.org) and go to the "Analytics" tab.

Enter your Telegram bot URL and Mini App domain to receive an access token for SDK initialization. You can also manage your existing keys from the same section.

### Initialize SDK

Now you can initialize the SDK in your application. There are two ways to do this:

- [Install with script tag](/ecosystem/tma/analytics/install-via-script)
- [Install with NPM package](/ecosystem/tma/analytics/install-via-npm)
