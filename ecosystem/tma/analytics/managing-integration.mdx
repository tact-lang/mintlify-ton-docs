[TON Builders](https://builders.ton.org) helps you manage your software development kit (SDK) keys and participate in various support programs from TON Foundation.

Register your project and go to the "Analytics" tab.

Enter your "Telegram bot URL" (Uniform Resource Locator (URL), <TELEGRAM_BOT_URL>) and "Mini App domain" (<MINI_APP_DOMAIN>) to receive an access token for SDK initialization. You can also manage your existing keys from the same section.
