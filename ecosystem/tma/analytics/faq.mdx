## Check Software Development Kit (SDK) integration status

### Use a bot

After completing the integration process using the steps described with [installation via `<script>` tag](/ecosystem/tma/analytics/install-via-script), the bot displays the time of the last recorded event in our database. If it shows something like "one minute ago", this means that everything is working correctly.

### Use developer tools

#### Desktop version

Go to Telegram “Settings”, then “Advanced Settings”, then “Experimental Settings”. Toggle “Enable webview inspecting”.

Next, open your application and right-click to open the developer console. In the “Network” section, you see the SDK script (`index.js`) loading and sending events. If you do not see it, refresh the application without closing Telegram Mini App (TMA).

#### Web version

Go to [Telegram's web version](https://web.telegram.org/), open the developer tools, go to the network section, open your TMA and filter queries by `tganalytics.xyz`. You see the SDK being loaded (`index.js`) and events being sent afterward.
