Cross-chain bridges are essential infrastructure components that enable interoperability between different blockchain networks. In the TON ecosystem, bridges facilitate the seamless transfer of assets and data between TON and other major blockchains like Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon.

In this article we will explore cross-chain bridges on TON.

## What are Cross-Chain Bridges?

Cross-chain bridges are protocols that allow users to transfer cryptocurrencies, tokens, and sometimes arbitrary data from one blockchain to another. They act as connectors between otherwise isolated blockchain networks, enabling a multi-chain ecosystem where assets can move freely across different platforms.

Bridges typically work by locking assets on the source blockchain and minting equivalent wrapped tokens on the destination blockchain. When users want to move assets back, the wrapped tokens are burned on the destination chain, and the original assets are unlocked on the source chain.

### Types of Cross-Chain Bridges

#### 1. Trustless vs. Custodial Bridges

Trustless Bridges:
- Use smart contracts and cryptographic proofs for validation
- No single point of failure
- Decentralized verification mechanisms

Centralized Bridges:
- Rely on trusted entities or multi-signature wallets
- Single point of failure risk
- Generally, are easier to implement


#### 2. Asset Transfer Methods

Lock-and-Mint Bridges:
- Lock original assets on source chain
- Mint wrapped tokens on destination chain
- Most common bridge type

Burn-and-Mint Bridges:
- Burn tokens on source chain
- Mint new tokens on destination chain
- Used for native multi-chain tokens

## Bridges on TON

The TON blockchain features a robust bridge ecosystem that connects it to major EVM-compatible networks. Based on the [TON Foundation bridge statistics](https://dune.com/ton_foundation/bridges), the ecosystem shows significant activity across multiple bridge providers.

### Legacy: Official TON Bridges

<Aside type='caution'>
  During early development of TON ecosystem (2021-2023 years) there were a few official TON bridges, supported at the protocol level. Now, they are considered legacy and not recommended for usage since they can be deprecated at any moment.
</Aside>

TON blockchain supports several official bridges configured at the protocol level:

#### Outbound Bridges (Config parameters 71-73)
These bridges wrap TON into other networks:
- **ETH-TON Bridge** (Parameter 71)
- **BNB-TON Bridge** (Parameter 72)
- **Polygon-TON Bridge** (Parameter 73)

#### Inbound Bridges (Config parameters 79, 81-82)
These bridges wrap tokens from other networks into TON:
- **ETH-TON Bridge** (Parameter 79)
- **BNB-TON Bridge** (Parameter 81)
- **Polygon-TON Bridge** (Parameter 82)
