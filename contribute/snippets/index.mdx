Snippets allow to conveniently keep the same content in sync, while components let you easily reuse a piece of UI or styling consistently. Examples might include a link card or a YouTube embed.

Mintlify supports the use of MDX snippets and JSX (React) components in MDX files and provides some built-in components for you to use. In addition to those, this documentation provides a number of custom components in the `snippets/` folder.

## Using a snippet

One of the core principles of software development is DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself), which applies to documentation as well. If you find yourself repeating the same content in multiple places, consider creating a custom snippet to keep your content in sync.

All snippets are placed in the root `snippets/` folder. For more info on their creation and usage, refer to [reusable snippets page in the Mintlify documentation](https://www.mintlify.com/docs/reusable-snippets).

## Using a component

You can use a component by importing it into your MDX file and then rendering it as a JSX tag. These look like HTML tags but start with an uppercase letter matching the name in your import statement:

```mdx title="some/page.mdx"
---
title: "Frontmatter goes first, as usual"
---

{/* Right after the formatter go the imports of snippets... */}
import MyMdxSnippet from '/snippets/my-mdx-snippet.mdx';

{/* ...and components */}
import { Aside } from '/snippets/aside.jsx';

And now, some text and usage!

<Aside>Here we go, some **nested content and formatting**!</Aside>
```
