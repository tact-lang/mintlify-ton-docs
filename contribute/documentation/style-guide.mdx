# TON documentation style guide

## 0. Purpose, scope, and normative terms

Purpose. This guide defines the required writing style for all public, developer‑facing TON documentation. Its goal is to maximize reading experience and task success: a developer should be able to land on the right page, follow it once, and succeed. This document is intentionally explicit so both humans and automated tools (including LLM reviewers) can apply it consistently.

Scope. These rules **MUST** be followed on all pages in the docs site, including, for example: tutorials/how‑tos, explanations, and references (CLI, TVM, standard contracts, network, config, serialization). Exceptions **MUST** be documented in Style exceptions with owner and expiry.

Normative terms. The keywords **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **MAY**, **RECOMMENDED**, and **OPTIONAL** are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119/8174.

Definitions (used throughout).

* Page — a single documentation article.
* Doc type — one of: Tutorial, How‑to guide, Explanation, Reference (see §3).
* Snippet — any code or command block.
* Partial snippet — a focused excerpt that **MAY** be non‑runnable by itself and **MUST** be labeled as such (see §10).
* Placeholder — a value the reader must replace; formatted as `<LIKE_THIS>`.
* Admonition — a callout such as Note, Tip, Important, Caution, or Warning.
* Reference anchor — a deep link to a specific item in a reference page (flag, field, error code, and similar items).

Out of scope. Editorial process, CI wiring, analytics/metrics, and governance live outside this guide. (This guide is about writing.)

Living document. This guide evolves with the documentation. Editors **MAY** update rules as the information architecture and best practices change. When the guide changes, all existing documentation **MUST** be re‑validated against the new rules and updated as needed to keep the docs consistent.

---

## 1. Goals and principles (reader‑first, answer‑first)

Intent. Every page exists to help a developer finish a real task quickly and correctly. Pages **MUST** optimize for clarity, scannability, accuracy, and trust; they **MUST NOT** contain marketing language in technical sections. Pages **SHOULD** be answer‑first (solution before theory) and example‑first (real code before exposition).

Principles.

1. Answer‑first. Open with purpose, outcome, and prerequisites. Then show the steps (or the API signature in reference). Background theory moves to its own Explanation page or a brief end section.
   Example (good):
   Goal: “Send a jetton from a web app.” Prereqs: JS SDK, funded testnet wallet. Steps: 1–5. Verify: expected output. Troubleshoot: common errors.
2. Example‑first and precise. Provide copy‑pasteable snippets with expected output. Use `<PLACEHOLDER>` values and define them at first use. Avoid unnecessary narrative around code.
3. Minimal concepts in task pages. Do not front‑load long explanations in tutorials/how‑tos. Link to a concept page instead.
4. Single source of truth. Don’t duplicate reference tables in guides. Summarize only what's needed, then link to the reference anchor.
5. Scannability. Prefer short paragraphs (≤ ~5 sentences) and short sentences (~15–20 words). Use headings, lists, and tables to chunk information. See §8 for norms and flexibility.

Anti‑patterns (MUST NOT). Vague claims (“blazingly fast”), filler (“simply”, “just”, “obviously”, “please note”), and long theoretical detours in task pages.

---

## 2. Audience and assumptions

Default audience. The primary reader is new to blockchain but experienced in software development. Pages **MUST NOT** re‑teach generic developer skills (e.g., basic shell, Git, Python/JS syntax) unless a step is unusual for TON.

Declaring prerequisites. Pages with advanced requirements **MUST** state them at the top (e.g., “Requires familiarity with TVM exit codes and TLB schemas.”). You **SHOULD** include a Prerequisites block on tutorials/how‑tos and a one‑line Summary on references to orient the reader.

Examples.

* Good prerequisite block:
  Prereqs: Node.js 20+, TON SDK JS, testnet wallet with funds, `<RPC_URL>` access.
* Good advanced notice (top of page):
  Audience: Advanced. Assumes understanding of WorkChain/ShardChain and TVM opcodes. Links: [WorkChain](/ton/states/), [TVM opcodes](/tvm/instructions/).

Inclusive/global readers. Use plain, international English; avoid idioms and culture‑specific references. Prefer neutral, inclusive terms (e.g., allowlist/denylist).

---

## 3. Documentation framework (content types)

Rule. Each page **MUST** be one of the following: Tutorial, How‑to guide, Explanation, or Reference. Types **MUST NOT** be mixed in a single page. The chosen type **MUST** be clear from the title and content and **MAY** be declared in frontmatter (`doc_type`).

Small, clearly marked asides (e.g., a 1–2‑step “Verify” box in an Explanation) **MAY** appear when they aid comprehension; the page’s primary type remains unchanged.

### 3.1 What each type means (and looks like)

* Tutorial (first success). Single happy path for newcomers. Hand‑holding is **RECOMMENDED**.
  Title style: “Deploy a counter contract on testnet”.
  Sections (suggested): Objective → Prereqs → Steps → Verify → Troubleshoot → Next steps. **SHOULD** avoid theory beyond two short bullets; link to an Explanation page.

* How‑to guide (goal‑oriented procedure). A recipe to achieve a specific outcome. **MUST** be procedural and concise.
  Title style: “Mint a jetton with the CLI”.
  Rule: **MUST NOT** embed long background; link to concepts as needed.

* Explanation (concepts/why). Background, architecture, trade‑offs. **SHOULD** avoid step lists and commands.
  Title style: “Account model and messages in TON”.

* Reference (complete, factual). Exhaustive specs for APIs/CLI/SDK/types/errors. Non‑narrative tables and exact semantics.
  Title style: “`tvm.runvm` — interface and exit codes”.
  Rule: **MUST** be precise, consistent, and anchor‑linkable.

---

## 4. Voice and tone

Objective. Sound like a helpful expert: professional, precise, and approachable. Use the same voice across all pages.

Rules (binding).

* Use second person (“you”), present tense, active voice. “Run the validator.” not “The validator will be run.”.
* Be neutral and inclusive. Avoid slang, idioms, culture‑specific jokes, or hype.
* **MUST NOT** use filler or patronizing words: simply, just, obviously, clearly, please note. Replace with exact instructions
* Emojis **MUST NOT** appear in technical pages. Use admonitions and clear text instead.
* Use plain terms over legalese/Latinisms. “Use” not “utilize”; “before” not “prior to.”
* “We” **SHOULD** refer only to the TON project/organization when necessary; avoid ambiguous “we”. Prefer direct second‑person, imperative instructions (addressed to “you”).

Micro‑examples.

* Bad: “We’ll just quickly configure the node; it’s super easy!”
  Good: “Configure the node.”
* Bad: “Let’s go ahead and utilize the script.”
  Good: “Run the script.”
* Bad: “Obviously the transaction fails if the fee is low.”
  Good: “The transaction fails if the fee is too low.”

---

## 5. Grammar and usage

Objective. Make sentences easy to parse on first read.

### 5.1 Voice, tense, and person

* You **MUST** use active voice by default. Passive voice **MAY** be used only when the actor is unknown or irrelevant.

  * Good: “The validator stops if the config is invalid.”
  * Bad: “The validator is stopped if the config is invalid.”
* You **MUST** use present tense for general behavior and instructions; future tense **SHOULD** be reserved for time‑dependent statements.

  * Good: “The API returns JSON.”
  * Bad: “The API will return JSON.”
* Address the reader as “you”. First‑person plural (“we”) **SHOULD** mean the TON project/organization, not “you and the author.” Prefer direct instructions.

### 5.2 Plain, precise wording

* You **SHOULD** prefer common words over legalese or Latinisms.

  * Use “use,” not “utilize.” Use “before,” not “prior to.”
* Hedging and filler **MUST NOT** appear: simply, just, obviously, clearly, please note. Replace with exact actions or facts.

### 5.3 Acronyms and terms

* On first mention, you **MUST** spell out the term and follow with the acronym in parentheses. Use the acronym thereafter.

  * Example: “The Open Network (TON)…”
* Project terminology **MUST** follow the term bank/glossary (see §13). Avoid introducing synonyms for the same concept.

### 5.4 Audience calibration

* Assume developers new to blockchain (but experienced in software). **MUST NOT** re‑teach generic developer skills unless a TON‑specific nuance requires it (see §2). Provide concise prerequisites when needed.

### 5.5 Global and inclusive language

* You **MUST** avoid idioms, cultural references, and biased terms. Prefer neutral alternatives (e.g., allowlist/denylist). Use people‑neutral wording and accessible examples.

### 5.6 Spelling and contractions

* Spelling **MUST** follow American English (e.g., color, analyze).
* Contractions (don’t, can’t) **MAY** be used when they improve flow and do not reduce clarity.

### 5.7 Avoid tautology, pleonasm, throat‑clearing, and circular references

Objective. Remove wordy redundancies and self‑referential boilerplate so the reader gets signal only.

#### Rules (normative)

* You **MUST** remove tautologies/pleonasms (duplicate meaning in different words).

  * Bad: “End result” → Good: “result”
  * Bad: “Advance planning” → Good: “planning”
  * Bad: “Free gift” → Good: “gift”

* You **MUST NOT** use throat‑clearing/circular openers that describe the doc instead of delivering value.

  * Bad: “In this section, we will discuss how to…”, “This document aims to explain…”
  * Good: “Deploy a validator on testnet.” (start with the action)

* You **SHOULD** collapse wordy boilerplate into precise verbs.

  * Bad: “In order to” → Good: “To”
  * Bad: “For the purpose of” → Good: “To”
  * Bad: “Due to the fact that” → Good: “Because”

* You **MUST** avoid doublets/triplets (pairs that mean the same thing).

  * Bad: “each and every”, “basic fundamentals”, “final outcome”, “past history”, “future plans going forward”, “merge together”, “close proximity”, “completely eliminate”

* You **MUST** avoid tautological logic and circular definitions.

  * Bad: “A jetton is a jetton if it conforms to the jetton standard.”
  * Good: “A jetton is a fungible token on TON defined by the Jetton standard, which specifies message formats for mint/transfer/burn.”

* You **SHOULD** replace hedges and intensifiers with facts.

  * Avoid: “basically”, “essentially”, “really”, “very”, “actually”, “literally” (unless literal).
  * If precision matters, give a number, constraint, or example instead.

* You **MUST NOT** use and/or.

  * Write: “A, B, or both” or “A or B” (choose one).

* You **SHOULD NOT** use etc. in procedures or lists.

  * Either complete the list or write “for example” and stop.

* You **MUST** avoid “as mentioned above/below”; link to the exact anchor instead (see §12).

* You **SHOULD** simplify “whether or not” → “whether”; “the reason is because” → “because”; “not uncommon” → “common/often.”

See also: Appendix B lists additional banned intensifiers and tone words.

#### Before/after micro‑examples

* Throat‑clearing

  * Before: “In this guide, we will show you how to configure a validator.”
  * After: “Configure a validator.”

* Tautology

  * Before: “The final outcome of the deployment process…”
  * After: “The result of the deployment…”

* Wordy boilerplate

  * Before: “In order to reduce fees, you need to…”
  * After: “To reduce fees, …”

* Hedge + intensifier

  * Before: “It’s basically very important to verify the address.”
  * After: “Verify the address.”

* Circular reference

  * Before: “Sharding improves scalability because it shards the chain.”
  * After: “Sharding splits the chain into parallel shards that process transactions concurrently, increasing throughput.”

---

## 6. Punctuation and mechanics

Objective. Remove ambiguity and increase scan speed with consistent mechanics.

### 6.1 Commas, colons, semicolons

* The Oxford (serial) comma **MUST** be used in lists of three or more items: “nodes, wallets, and explorers.”
* Comma splices **MUST NOT** occur. If two clauses can stand alone, use a period or coordinating conjunction.

  * Bad: “The node restarts, it begins syncing.”
  * Good: “The node restarts. It then begins syncing.”
* Colons **SHOULD** introduce lists or explanations after a complete clause. Semicolons **SHOULD** be rare. Prefer shorter sentences.

### 6.2 Quotation marks and emphasis

* Quotation marks **MUST** be used only for actual quotations or literal UI text/messages, not for emphasis.

  * Good: The error message “Account not found” appears.
  * Bad: The “validator” node… (do not quote terms)
* House rule — quoting style: Use the international style with American spelling. Quotation punctuation **MUST** remain outside closing quotes unless it is part of the quoted text. This differs from American book style; keep it consistent.

  * Use double quotation marks for UI/log/error strings; place punctuation outside unless it’s part of the string.
  * This rule applies to quoted UI/log/error strings only; it does not apply to code spans or headings.

  * Good (international): Click “Settings”, then select “Network”.
  * Bad (American style here): Click “Settings,” then select “Network.”

* UI and log messages **MUST** appear verbatim in quotation marks; **MUST NOT** add emphasis or change casing/punctuation.
* Error codes/identifiers **MUST** use code formatting: `ERR_FEE_TOO_LOW`, `EADDRINUSE`, `ENOENT`.
* When paraphrasing behavior, you **MUST NOT** alter message semantics; label paraphrases clearly and avoid quotation marks.



### 6.3 Code styling

* Code, filenames, paths, API endpoints, flags, and literals **MUST** use code formatting (inline backticks or fenced blocks). **MUST NOT** add punctuation inside code that isn’t part of the code.

### 6.4 Lists

* Use numbered lists for procedures and bulleted lists for unordered sets. If list items are full sentences, **SHOULD** end with periods; otherwise, omit terminal punctuation consistently.

---

## 7. Headings and titles

Objective. Make navigation obvious and sections self‑explanatory.

### 7.1 Case and form

* All headings **MUST** use sentence case (capitalize only the first word and proper nouns).
* Task (procedure) headings **MUST** start with an imperative verb; concept headings **SHOULD** be noun phrases.

  * Task: “Deploy a validator.”
  * Concept: “Validator architecture.”

### 7.2 Gerunds and labels

* For task/procedure headings (H2/H3), gerunds (e.g., “Creating…”, “Configuring…”) **SHOULD NOT** be used. Prefer imperative verbs.
* Concept headings **MAY** use concise noun phrases (e.g., “Naming”, “Spelling”, “Versioning”).
* Fixed labels like Troubleshooting, Changelog, or FAQ are acceptable. Imperatives read cleaner and translate better in procedural sections.
* House default: use “Troubleshoot” by default; “Troubleshooting” is acceptable when aligning with established ecosystem conventions.

### 7.3 Uniqueness and linkability

* Headings **MUST** be unique at the same nesting level within a page and **MUST** make sense out of context (as TOC/sidebar links). Avoid repeated “Introduction” sections; prefer specific names.

### 7.4 Formatting restrictions

* Headings **MUST NOT** contain styling other than text: no bold, italics, `code`, quotes, or ALL CAPS (acronyms permitted). Keep headings clean; use formatting in body text only.
* Exceptions:
  * Reference pages only: Headings **MAY** include code font for identifiers (API names, flags, error codes), e.g., `tvm.runvm` — interface and exit codes.
  * When the heading contains a literal UI/log/error message, quotation marks **MAY** be included (e.g., Fix “Account not found”).

### 7.5 Practical length norms

* Headings **SHOULD** be concise. As a norm, H1 ≤ ~60 characters, H2/H3 ≤ ~70 characters. Exceed only for clarity.

Examples (good):

* “Run a validator on testnet” (H2, imperative)
* “Account model and messages in TON” (H2, concept)
Examples (bad):
* “Running and configuring the validator” (gerunds)
* “How the `validator` works” (code in heading)

---

## 8. Readability and scannability

Objective. Keep text fast to read and effortless to scan.

### 8.1 Paragraphs and sentences

* One idea per paragraph. Paragraphs **SHOULD** be ≤ 5 sentences; single‑sentence paragraphs are acceptable for emphasis. These are recommended norms, not hard caps—exceed only when clarity requires it.
* Sentences **SHOULD** average 15–20 words. Long, multi‑clause sentences **SHOULD** be split. Front‑load key points.

### 8.2 Structure for scanning

* Use subheadings, lists, and tables to break up dense text. Provide breathing room around code, tables, and images (blank lines before/after blocks).
* Highlight critical notes with admonitions (Note/Tip/Important/Caution/Warning) sparingly so they retain impact.
* This guidance does not limit required safety callouts in §11; when in doubt, include the safety callout.

### 8.3 Micro‑examples

Before (hard to scan):
“After deploying, if fees are misconfigured the transaction might fail and the node logs a warning; you can retry after adjusting the config, but it’s better to verify the fee policy first because otherwise the wallet may reject the message.”

After (scannable):

* Verify fees before deploying.
* If the transaction fails with `FEE_TOO_LOW`:

  1. Update the fee policy.
  2. Retry the deployment.
* The node logs a warning on failure.

---

## 9. Recommended page structures (by type)

Objective. Make pages predictable without forbidding alternatives.
Rule. The patterns below are **RECOMMENDED**. You **MAY** deviate when another structure improves clarity, but pages in the same section **SHOULD** be consistent.

### 9.1 Tutorials (first success)

Recommended sections:
Objective → Prerequisites → Steps (3–7) → Verify (expected output or result) → Troubleshoot (common errors) → Next steps.
Notes: Keep a single happy path; theory **SHOULD** be limited to ≤ two bullets and linked to an Explanation page.

Example outline (good):

* Objective: “Deploy a counter contract on testnet.”
* Prerequisites: Node.js 20+, TON SDK JS, funded testnet wallet, `<RPC_URL>`.
* Steps: 1) Initialize project … 2) Compile … 3) Deploy …
* Verify: “Expected output” block showing successful deployment.
* Troubleshoot: `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS`, `INVALID_WORKCHAIN` fixes.
* Next steps: Link to contract upgrades guide.

### 9.2 How‑to guides (goal‑oriented procedures)

Recommended sections:
Goal → Prerequisites → Steps → Result → Links to Reference (anchor each flag/param).
Notes: Do not embed long background; link to concepts instead. Keep each step a single action with sub‑bullets for options.

### 9.3 Explanations (concepts/why)

Recommended sections:
What/Why → Core concepts → Trade‑offs → Related topics.
Notes: Avoid command sequences. Use diagrams and short examples to illustrate concepts.

### 9.4 Reference (complete, factual)

Recommended sections:
Summary → Parameters/Fields (tables) → Returns/Responses → Errors (codes, meanings) → Examples (minimal usage) → See also (anchors).
Notes: Be exhaustive and anchor‑linkable; minimize narrative. Keep formats consistent across entries.

---

## 10. Code and command examples

Objective. Ensure examples are precise, copy‑pasteable, and unambiguous.

### 10.1 General rules

* Examples **MUST** be copy‑pasteable. **MUST NOT** include shell prompts (`$`, `>`) in command blocks.
* Command and expected output **MUST** be presented as separate fenced blocks.
* Placeholders **MUST** use `<ANGLE_CASE>` (e.g., `<RPC_URL>`, `<LEDGER_DIR>`), and each placeholder **MUST** be defined on first use.
* Fenced code blocks **MUST** specify a language (` ```bash `, ` ```rust `, ` ```json `, …).
* Filenames shown in examples **MUST** be realistic and kebab‑case (e.g., `wallet-config.json`, not `MyConfig.json`).
* Long commands **MUST NOT** be hard‑wrapped. Prefer UI soft wrap. If a tool supports safe line continuation (e.g., `\` in POSIX shells), continuation **MAY** be used and must be copy‑pasteable as shown.
* You **SHOULD** favor examples that run end‑to‑end on testnet by default.
* Inside language code, placeholders **SHOULD** be neutral (e.g., `UPPER_SNAKE` inside strings or comments) when angle brackets would clash with language syntax; in commands and prose, placeholders **MUST** use `<ANGLE_CASE>`.


### Error and log style

* Quoted UI/log messages **MUST** appear verbatim in quotation marks.
* Error codes and identifiers **MUST** be rendered in code font (e.g., `ERR_FEE_TOO_LOW`).
* When summarizing behavior instead of quoting, **MUST NOT** change semantics and avoid using quotes; indicate that it is a summary.

Good

```bash
ton-node start --ledger <LEDGER_DIR> --network testnet
```

Expected output

```text
Node started. Workchain: 0  Shard: -1  Status: running
```

Define placeholders (first use):
`<LEDGER_DIR>` — path to your local ledger directory.
`<RPC_URL>` — HTTPS endpoint of your TON RPC provider.

Bad

```bash
$ ton-node start --ledger /home/bob/ledger --network mainnet  # includes prompt, hard-coded values
```

### 10.2 Partial snippets

* Partial snippets (focused excerpts) **MAY** be used when teaching a narrow concept, even if not runnable alone.
* Partial snippets **MUST** be labeled clearly above the block: “Not runnable”.
* Partial snippets **SHOULD** link to a full runnable example or reference entry showing complete context.

Not runnable

```rust
let to = Address::from_str("EQC_REPLACE_WITH_ADDRESS").unwrap();
let amount = Coins::from_nano(1_000_000_000);
let body = build_transfer_body(to, amount);
```

### 10.3 Safety and secrets in code

* Secrets (keys, mnemonics, API tokens) **MUST NOT** appear in examples. Use placeholders or test keys that are clearly invalid.
* Commands that could cause loss of funds or data **MUST** be guarded by a Warning/Caution per §11 and **SHOULD** default to testnet.

### 10.4 OS and language variants

* When steps differ by OS or language, you **SHOULD** provide tabs or distinct subsections (e.g., Linux / macOS / Windows; JS / Python / Rust).
* If only one variant is provided, the page **MUST** state that limitation.

### 10.5 Comments and omissions

* Use language‑appropriate comments to mark omissions (`// …`); **MUST NOT** use literal ellipses that change syntax.
* Keep comments minimal and instructional; avoid commentary or humor.

---

## 11. Safety‑critical content (blockchain‑specific)

Objective. Prevent reader harm when funds, keys, or validator/network state are involved.

### 11.1 When a safety callout is required

A Caution or Warning **MUST** appear when a page or step:

* moves funds or changes fee/withdrawal behavior;
* exposes, stores, or transmits private keys/mnemonics;
* modifies validator configuration, networking, or consensus‑affecting parameters;
* performs chain‑affecting operations (e.g., resharding, pruning, halting, replay).

### 11.2 How to write the callout

A safety callout **MUST** include:

1. Risk (what can go wrong),
2. Scope (what the command affects),
3. Rollback/mitigation steps, and
4. Environment label (testnet vs mainnet) with safer default instructions first.

Warning — funds at risk
Running the following command on mainnet can transfer funds irreversibly.
Do first (testnet):

```bash
jetton transfer --to <ADDR> --amount <AMOUNT> --network testnet
```

If you must use mainnet: Rollback: none—on‑chain transfers are final.

### 11.3 Safer defaults

* Task pages **SHOULD** use testnet endpoints by default and mention the switch to mainnet explicitly.
* Destructive flags (e.g., `--purge`, `--force`) **MUST** be opt‑in and accompanied by a callout.

### 11.4 Key handling and storage

* Keys **MUST** be represented as placeholders or generated ephemeral testing artifacts.
* In guides, prefer environment variables or keystores; never inline secrets.
* Reference pages **MAY** document secure storage options but **MUST NOT** encourage unsafe patterns.

---

## 12. Links and cross‑references

Objective. Reduce duplication and let readers jump straight to detail.

### 12.1 Link text

* Link text **MUST** be descriptive. Avoid “click here,” “this,” or bare URLs.

  * Good: “See validator flags.”
  * Bad: “Click here for flags.”

### 12.2 What to link (and what not)

* In a guide, the first useful mention of a flag, parameter, error code, or data type **SHOULD** link to the canonical reference anchor.
* Repeat links **SHOULD NOT** be added within the same major section unless separation by many screens would help the reader.
* Link concepts judiciously: if the reader is likely to wonder “what does that mean?” then link the term on its first useful mention.
* On the first useful mention of a core TON term on a page, you **SHOULD** link to the Glossary (Foundations → Glossary), unless the page itself defines it.
* Over‑linking common words is discouraged; link what is plausibly useful.
* Guides **MUST NOT** duplicate reference tables; summarize and link instead.

Example (good)

> Start the node with `--threads` (see [validator flags → `--threads`](/reference/nodes/validator/#threads)) to increase parallelism.

### 12.3 Link targets and format

* Internal links **SHOULD** be relative and stable; anchors **MUST** resolve correctly.
* Cross‑section links **SHOULD** jump to precise anchors instead of page tops.
* A See also section **SHOULD** close longer pages with 3–7 highly relevant links.

### 12.4 Avoid circularity and drift

* Each fact **MUST** have a single canonical home. If you need the same fact elsewhere, link to it.
* **MUST NOT** link to outdated or superseded pages except when documenting historical behavior.

---




## 13. Terminology and naming

Objective. Enforce a single source of truth for terms and casing.

### 13.1 Term bank (canonical source)

* A project term bank **MUST** define canonical terms, spellings, hyphenation, casing, and banned variants with replacements (e.g., allowlist/denylist for whitelist/blacklist).
* You **MUST** consult the term bank before introducing new names; additions **SHOULD** be reviewed by editors.

### 13.2 General casing rules

* Generic concepts **MUST NOT** be capitalized mid‑sentence (use “smart contract,” not “Smart Contract”).
* Proper nouns and official product/feature names **MUST** follow the term bank (e.g., TON, TON Connect).
* Code identifiers (types, fields, flags) **MUST** appear in code font with exact case.

### 13.3 Hyphenation and abbreviations

* Multi‑word mechanism names are common nouns and **SHOULD** be hyphenated: proof‑of‑stake, zero‑knowledge.
* Abbreviated forms **MUST** follow the project style: ZK‑proof, ZK‑rollup (uppercase ZK, hyphenated compound).
* Use mainnet as a common noun; use TON Mainnet when referring to the proper name of the network. (Declare this explicitly in the term bank.)
* Use testnet as a common noun; use TON Testnet when referring to the proper name of the network.

### 13.4 TON‑specific examples
Non‑exhaustive; finalize in the term bank.

* TON, TON Blockchain, TON Ecosystem (proper nouns).
* smart contract, account, message, jetton, nominator, validator, collator, node, liteserver (common nouns, lowercase mid‑sentence).
* AccountChain, ShardChain, WorkChain, MasterChain, BaseChain — follow canonical casing as defined in the term bank; **MUST NOT** invent alternates (e.g., “Shard Chain”).
* BoC (abbrev.) / bag of cells (common noun). Abbreviation **MUST** be “BoC” (not “BOC”).
Note: MasterChain is an official TON term and **MAY** be used as a proper noun. **MUST NOT** introduce “master/slave” metaphors in new text; use primary/replica or similar.

### 13.5 Placeholder names

* In commands and prose, placeholders **MUST** be `<ANGLE_CASE>` with descriptive names: `<WALLET_ADDR>`, `<AMOUNT_TON>`, `<RPC_URL>`.
* In programming‑language code, placeholders **MAY** use `UPPER_SNAKE` without angle brackets when `< >` would clash with syntax (see §10.1).
* **MUST NOT** use `{curly}` or `[square]` placeholder syntax in copy‑pasteable commands, as they are easy to misread as literal characters.

### 13.6 Banned and preferred terms

* Banned: simply, just, obviously, clearly, please note; whitelist/blacklist; master/slave; sanity check.
* Preferred: (omit filler); allowlist/denylist; primary/replica; smoke check or basic check.
  Rationale: clarity, inclusivity, and reduced ambiguity.

---

## 14. Numbers, units, date, and time

Objective. Present quantitative information unambiguously for a global developer audience.

### 14.1 Numerals and separators

* You **MUST** use numerals for all technical quantities (latency, memory, fees, block heights, versions, ports), regardless of size.

  * Good: “Set the fee to 0.2 TON.”
* For general prose without units, you **MAY** spell out zero–nine and use numerals for 10+, but prefer numerals whenever a value matters to a task.
* You **SHOULD** use thousands separators for numbers ≥ 10,000: 10,000, 1,234,567.
* **MUST NOT** add separators to codes/IDs (e.g., block hashes, transaction IDs, addresses), even if they contain digits; keep copyable values intact.
* Decimal separator **MUST** be a dot: 3.1415.

### 14.2 Units and conventions

* Use binary units (KiB, MiB, GiB) for memory/storage sizes and SI units (kB, MB, Gbps, ms) for network throughput, latency, and timing. Be consistent within each category.
* Currency amounts **MUST** specify the unit (e.g., TON, USDT). When precision matters, show decimals explicitly (e.g., 0.000001 TON).
* Address/hash values **MUST NOT** be silently truncated. If truncation aids readability, use a consistent truncation pattern (e.g., first 4 / last 4 with an ellipsis: `EQC…9gA`) and state clearly that the value is truncated.

### 14.3 Dates and times

* Dates **MUST** use ISO‑8601 format YYYY‑MM‑DD (e.g., 2025‑02‑11).
* Times **SHOULD** be 24‑hour and, where relevant, UTC (e.g., 14:30 UTC).
  * Use UTC for timestamps that might be compared across regions (e.g., transactions, block times, cron examples).
* Ranges **MUST** be explicit: 2025‑02‑11 14:30–15:00 UTC.
* **MUST NOT** use ambiguous forms like `11/2/2025`.
* Changelogs **SHOULD** include a date stamp in ISO format.

### 14.4 Magnitudes and math

* Prefer engineering prefixes for readability: 1.2 GiB, 250 ms, 500 kB/s.
* Inline math **SHOULD** use KaTeX/LaTeX components when formulas help clarity.

Rationale: Consistent numeric style reduces misreads and eases localization.

---

## 15. Accessibility and internationalization

Objective. Ensure content is usable by all readers and easy to localize.

### 15.1 Language and reading

* Content **MUST** use plain, international English; avoid idioms, slang, and culture‑specific metaphors.
* Link text and headings **MUST** be descriptive (screen‑reader friendly). Avoid “click here” (see §12).
* Avoid gendered or ableist terms; use inclusive alternatives (see Appendix B).

### 15.2 Structure and tables

* Tables **SHOULD** include header rows; keep cell content short and scannable.
* Units **MUST** be shown in headers or cells (e.g., “Latency (ms)”, “Size — MiB”).
* Cells **SHOULD NOT** contain multi‑paragraph text; move extended explanations below the table.
* Long lists inside cells **SHOULD** be converted to bullet lists placed below the table.
* Provide text alternatives for complex figures when feasible.
* Keyboard‑only navigation **SHOULD** be considered when adding interactive elements.

### 15.3 Localization readiness

* Prefer stable terminology from the term bank (Appendix B references) to minimize translation drift.
* Dates/times already follow ISO conventions (see §14.3), which **SHOULD** simplify localization.

Rationale: Clear, inclusive writing and accessible assets improve comprehension for global audiences and translation tools.

## 16. File, navigation, and frontmatter conventions

Objective. Keep repository structure and UI labels consistent.

### 16.1 Files and titles

* Filenames **MUST** use kebab‑case.md or kebab‑case.mdx (e.g., `validator-setup.mdx`).
* Each page **MUST** have exactly one H1 that is the first visible content on the page and matches the page title. Frontmatter and MDX imports **MAY** appear above the H1 in source.

### 16.2 Navigation labels

* Sidebar and nav labels **SHOULD** be short (2–4 words), unique, and mirror in‑page headings.
* Sidebar labels **MAY** be concise aliases of the H1; they **SHOULD** preserve the H1’s meaning even if wording is shortened.
* Avoid duplicate “Introduction” labels—make them specific (e.g., “Intro to sharding”).
* Frontmatter (recommended, not mandatory): each page **MAY** declare `doc_type: tutorial | how-to | explanation | reference` for tooling and reader orientation. Pages **MAY** also declare `audience: beginner | advanced` and `status: experimental | deprecated` (see §16.4).

### 16.3 Links and anchors

* Internal links **SHOULD** be relative to avoid domain coupling; ensure anchors are stable.
* Trailing slashes: Follow a single repo‑wide policy set by the site generator, and apply it consistently across all internal links.
* Cross‑section links **SHOULD** target specific anchors rather than page tops.



### 16.4 Status labels

* Pages and features **MAY** declare a status in frontmatter: `experimental` or `deprecated`.
* If deprecated, the page **MUST** include a top‑of‑page Important callout that states the replacement (link to successor) and the removal timeline (date or version).
* If experimental, briefly state scope and limitations; link to the stable alternative when available.
* Status labels (experimental/deprecated) are independent of safety callouts (see §11). Apply both when applicable.

## 17. Content hygiene and timeless writing

Objective. Reduce staleness, duplication, and maintenance costs.

### 17.1 Single source of truth

* Each fact **MUST** have a canonical home. If you need the same fact elsewhere, link to it (see §12).
* Guides **MUST NOT** replicate reference tables; summarize and link.

### 17.2 Timelessness

* You **SHOULD NOT** use words like “currently”, “new”, or “soon”.
* Prefer durable phrasing: “Since v2.3, X is supported,” not “newly added.”
* Remove version qualifiers once they’re no longer useful.

### 17.3 Freshness and updates

* When behavior changes, the relevant pages **MUST** be updated promptly.
* Large refactors **SHOULD** include redirects and update cross‑links.
* Avoid re‑documenting external tools; link to official docs and focus on TON‑specific usage.

### 17.4 Proofread

* Read aloud or skim with a “scanner’s eye”; long sentences **SHOULD** be split (see §8).
* Check terms against the term bank; enforce casing and spelling consistently.


Rationale: “Timeless” style and a canonical home for facts keep the docs trustworthy and maintainable.

---

## 18. Style exceptions and edge cases

Objective. Provide a controlled escape hatch without eroding consistency.

* Any deviation from this guide **MUST** document: the rule being overridden, the reason, the scope (pages affected), the owner, and an expiry or review date.
* Exceptions **SHOULD** be rare, time‑boxed, and revisited.
* For audience‑critical reasons (e.g., highly advanced research notes), a page **MAY** relax sentence‑length norms (§8) or include extra theory in a how‑to (§3), but the page **MUST** clearly state the rationale at the top (e.g., Audience: Advanced).
* A safety requirement (§11) **MUST NOT** be waived.

Rationale: Exceptions exist to serve clarity, not convenience. They are documented so future editors can normalize them later.

## 19. Appendices

### A. Admonition levels and usage

Use the least severe callout that communicates the point; overuse reduces impact.

| Level         | When to use                                                  | MUST include                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Note      | Auxiliary info or minor edge cases                           | Short, actionable text only                         |
| Tip       | Productivity boosters, shortcuts                             | A clear benefit (“Saves time by …”)                 |
| Important | Prerequisites, state assumptions, gotchas                    | The condition and its effect                        |
| Caution   | Potential data loss or non‑recoverable state                 | Risk + mitigation/rollback                          |
| Warning   | Security, funds/keys/validator risk, chain‑affecting ops     | Risk + scope + rollback + testnet/mainnet label     |

Examples

* Important — prerequisite
  “This guide requires a funded testnet wallet.”

* Caution — data loss
  “`--purge-ledger` removes local data. Back up `<LEDGER_DIR>` before running.”

* Warning — funds at risk
  “Transfers on mainnet are final.”

(Admonition usage aligns with the safety requirements in §11.)
