# TON docs style guide

> This page is for people writing docs. It keeps only the fundamentals: how pages are structured, how examples should look, and how to keep things consistent. The long, explicit guide is still the source of truth for automation.

---

## Optimize for outcomes

* Start answer‑first. Open with what the reader will achieve, the prerequisites, then the steps. Why: people come to finish a task, not to read theory first.
* Lead with a working example. Show a copy‑pasteable snippet early and the expected output. Why: concrete success builds trust and momentum.
* Keep a single source of truth. Summarize only what is needed and link to the reference for details. Why: duplicated facts drift and contradict each other.
* Make it scannable. Use short sections and paragraphs, clear headings, lists, and tables. Why: most readers skim to find the next action.
* Use a neutral, precise tone. Write in second person and present tense (“Run the node”). Avoid hype and filler. Why: direct language is faster to follow and easier to translate.

---

## Choose the right page type

* Tutorial — first success on one happy path.
  Outline: Objective → Prerequisites → Steps (3–7) → Verify → Troubleshoot → Next steps.
  Why: a predictable arc gets newcomers to a working result quickly.

* How‑to guide — a focused recipe for a specific outcome.
  Outline: Goal → Prerequisites → Steps → Result → Links to Reference.
  Why: clear steps with a defined result reduce guesswork.

* Explanation — concepts, architecture, trade‑offs, why things work.
  Outline: What/Why → Core concepts → Trade‑offs → Related topics.
  Why: separating “why” from “how” avoids mixing goals.

* Reference — complete, factual spec for APIs, CLI, SDKs, types, errors.
  Outline: Summary → Parameters/Fields → Returns/Responses → Errors → Minimal example → See also.
  Why: uniform tables and anchors make lookups fast.

Do not mix types on the same page. A small aside (for example, a short “Verify” box in an Explanation) is fine if it helps comprehension.

## Write examples that run

* Make commands copy‑pasteable. Do not include shell prompts like `$` or `>`. Why: prompts get copied and break commands.
* Separate command and output in different fenced blocks. Why: mixing them causes copy errors and confusion.
* Use `<ANGLE_CASE>` placeholders in commands and prose, and define each on first use (for example, `<RPC_URL>`). In code, use `UPPER_SNAKE` if `< >` would clash with syntax. Why: one visible convention prevents hard‑coded values from leaking into examples.
* Tag code fences with a language (`bash`, `json`, `rust`, and so on). Why: correct highlighting and tooling.
* Prefer end‑to‑end examples on testnet by default. Why: safer to try and easier to verify.
* Label partial snippets as Not runnable and link to a full example. Why: sets expectations and gives a path to success.
* Do not hard‑wrap long commands. Use UI soft wrap, or safe continuation if the shell supports it. Why: hard wraps break execution.

Good

```bash
ton-node start --ledger <LEDGER_DIR> --network testnet
```

Expected output

```text
Node started. Workchain: 0  Shard: -1  Status: running
```

Define placeholders
`<LEDGER_DIR>` — local ledger directory.
`<RPC_URL>` — HTTPS endpoint of your TON RPC provider.

## Show safety clearly

Add a Caution or Warning when a step moves funds, changes fees or withdrawals, exposes or stores private keys or mnemonics, modifies validator or network settings, or performs chain‑affecting operations (resharding, pruning, halting, replay). Why: these actions can cause irreversible loss or outages.

Pattern

> Warning — funds at risk
> Running the next command on mainnet transfers funds irreversibly.
> Safer first (testnet):
>
> ```bash
> jetton transfer --to <ADDR> --amount <AMOUNT> --network testnet
> ```
>
> If you must use mainnet: no rollback; on‑chain transfers are final.

Default to testnet in task pages. Make destructive flags opt‑in and document mitigations. Why: safe defaults prevent costly mistakes.

## Titles, headings, navigation

* Use sentence case, keep them concise and unique. Why: clean labels scan better and avoid duplicate anchors.
* Tasks use imperatives (“Deploy a validator”), concepts use nouns (“Validator architecture”). Why: titles signal action vs. explanation.
* Do not style headings (no code font, bold, italics), except reference identifiers where needed. Why: styling clutters the TOC and reduces readability.
* Use clear section labels like Verify, Troubleshoot, See also. Why: readers recognize these patterns and find what they need faster.

---

## Link to details, do not duplicate them

* On first useful mention, link flags, parameters, error codes, or data types to their reference anchors. Why: readers get exact details when needed.
* Do not paste reference tables into guides; link instead. Why: repeated tables go stale.
* Use descriptive link text (“See validator flags → `--threads`”), not “click here”. Why: better for scanning and accessibility.
* Link core TON terms to the Glossary on first useful mention unless you define them on the page. Why: consistent definitions reduce confusion.
* Prefer stable, relative internal links and precise anchors. Why: links keep working when the site moves.

---

## Voice and readability

* Write for developers who may be new to blockchain. Do not re‑teach generic skills unless a TON‑specific nuance requires it. Why: keeps pages focused and shorter.
* Use present tense, active voice, and second person. Why: direct instructions are easier to follow.
* One idea per paragraph. Keep paragraphs short; break long sequences into lists and tables. Why: short chunks are easier to scan.
* Avoid filler and hedges (“simply”, “just”, “obviously”). State the action or fact. Why: filler adds words without adding value.

Before: “We’ll just quickly configure the node; it’s super easy.”
After: “Configure the node.”

---

## Terminology and names

* Use the project term bank for canonical spellings, casing, and preferred terms. Why: one vocabulary prevents drift.
  Examples: TON, jetton, smart contract, BoC (bag of cells), AccountChain, ShardChain, WorkChain, MasterChain, BaseChain.
* Prefer allowlist and denylist over whitelist and blacklist. Why: clearer and inclusive.
* Use mainnet and testnet as common nouns. Use TON Mainnet and TON Testnet when referring to the proper names. Why: distinguishes the generic type from the named network.

---

## Files, frontmatter, labels

* Filenames use `kebab-case.md` or `kebab-case.mdx` (for example, `validator-setup.mdx`). Why: readable and consistent across platforms.
* Start each page with a single H1 that matches the page title. Why: clean TOC and anchors.
* Optional frontmatter can declare `doc_type`, `audience`, and `status` (experimental or deprecated). If deprecated, add an Important callout with the replacement and timeline. Why: sets expectations for readers and reviewers.
* Sidebar labels are short (2–4 words) and mirror in‑page headings. Why: prevents truncation and duplicate labels.

---

## Accessibility and international readers

* Use plain, international English; avoid idioms and culture‑specific references. Why: idioms do not translate well.
* Write descriptive headings and link text. Why: screen readers and skimmers rely on them.
* Tables have headers and units (for example, “Latency (ms)”). Keep cells brief. Why: structure improves comprehension.
* Provide text alternatives for complex figures when feasible. Why: makes visuals usable for more readers.

---

## Secrets, data, environments

* Never include real keys, mnemonics, or tokens. Use placeholders or clearly invalid test values. Why: prevents accidental leaks.
* Prefer environment variables or keystores over inlining secrets. Why: reduces exposure in history and logs.
* Call out any command that can delete, rewrite, or lock state. Why: flags risk before damage.
* Label the environment explicitly when it matters (testnet vs. mainnet). Why: avoids running risky steps on the wrong network.
