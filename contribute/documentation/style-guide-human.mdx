# TON docs style guide

> This page is for people writing docs. It keeps only the fundamentals: how pages are structured, how examples should look, and how to keep things consistent. The long, explicit guide is still the source of truth for automation.

---

## 1) What every page should optimize for

* Answer‑first. Start with what the reader will achieve, the prerequisites, then the steps. Put background theory at the end or link to an explanation page.
* Example‑first. Show a working snippet early. Prefer copy‑pasteable examples with expected output.
* Single source of truth. Don’t duplicate reference tables in guides. Summarize what’s needed and link to the reference anchor.
* Scannability. Short sections, short paragraphs, clear headings, lists, and tables.
* Neutral, precise tone. Direct instructions, present tense, second person (“Run the node.”). Avoid hype and filler.

---

## 2) Doc types at a glance

1. Tutorial – first success for newcomers on a single happy path.
   Suggested outline: Objective → Prerequisites → Steps (3–7) → Verify → Troubleshoot → Next steps

2. How‑to guide – a focused recipe to reach a specific outcome.
   Suggested outline: Goal → Prerequisites → Steps → Result → Links to Reference

3. Explanation – concepts, architecture, trade‑offs, why things work.
   Suggested outline: What/Why → Core concepts → Trade‑offs → Related topics

4. Reference – complete, factual spec for APIs/CLI/SDK/types/errors.
   Suggested outline: Summary → Parameters/Fields → Returns/Responses → Errors → Minimal example → See also

> Don’t mix types on the same page. A brief aside (for example, a 1–2‑step “Verify” box in an Explanation) is fine if it helps comprehension.

## 3) Examples and snippets

* Copy‑pasteable. No shell prompts like `$` or `>` in command blocks.
* Separate command and output. Two fenced blocks: one to run, one for expected output.
* Placeholders. Use `<ANGLE_CASE>` in commands and prose (e.g., `<RPC_URL>`). Define each placeholder on first use.

  * In programming language code, use `UPPER_SNAKE` if `< >` would clash with syntax.
* Language tags. Always set the fence language (`bash`, `json`, `rust`, …).
* Runnable by default. Prefer testnet and end‑to‑end examples the reader can try immediately.
* Partial snippets. If a code excerpt isn’t runnable, label it Not runnable above the block and link to the full example.

Good

```bash
ton-node start --ledger <LEDGER_DIR> --network testnet
```

Expected output

```text
Node started. Workchain: 0  Shard: -1  Status: running
```

Define placeholders
`<LEDGER_DIR>` — local ledger directory.
`<RPC_URL>` — HTTPS endpoint of your TON RPC provider.

## 4) Safety callouts

Add a Caution or Warning when a step:

* moves funds or changes fee/withdrawal behavior;
* exposes or stores private keys/mnemonics;
* modifies validator/network/consensus settings;
* performs chain‑affecting operations (resharding, pruning, halting, replay).

Pattern

> Warning — funds at risk
> Running the next command on mainnet transfers funds irreversibly.
> Safer first (testnet):
>
> ```bash
> jetton transfer --to <ADDR> --amount <AMOUNT> --network testnet
> ```
>
> If you must use mainnet: no rollback; on‑chain transfers are final.

Default to testnet in task pages. Make destructive flags opt‑in and document mitigations.

---

## 5) Headings, titles, and navigation

* Sentence case for all headings; keep them concise and unique.
* Tasks use imperatives. “Deploy a validator,” not “Deploying a validator.”
* Concepts use nouns. “Validator architecture.”
* No styling in headings (no code font/bold/italics), except reference identifiers where needed.
* Use clear section labels like Verify, Troubleshoot, See also.

---

## 6) Linking and single‑source rules

* Link the first useful mention of any flag, parameter, error code, or data type to its reference anchor.
* Don’t paste reference tables into guides; link instead.
* Use descriptive link text (“See validator flags → `--threads`”), not “click here”.
* Link core TON terms to the Glossary on their first useful mention (unless the page defines them).
* Prefer stable, relative internal links and precise anchors.

---

## 7) Voice and readability

* Write for developers who may be new to blockchain. Don’t re‑teach generic skills unless a TON‑specific nuance requires it.
* Use present tense, active voice, and second person.
* Keep paragraphs short (one idea each). Break up long sequences with lists and tables.
* Avoid filler and hedges (e.g., “simply”, “just”, “obviously”). State the action or fact.

Before: “We’ll just quickly configure the node; it’s super easy.”
After: “Configure the node.”

---

## 8) Terminology and naming

* Use the project term bank for canonical spellings, casing, and preferred terms.

  * Examples: TON, jetton, smart contract, BoC (bag of cells), AccountChain/ShardChain/WorkChain/MasterChain/BaseChain (exact casing).
* Prefer allowlist/denylist over whitelist/blacklist.
* Use mainnet and testnet as common nouns; write TON Mainnet and TON Testnet when referring to the proper names.

---

## 9) Files, frontmatter, and labels

* Filenames use `kebab-case.md` or `kebab-case.mdx` (e.g., `validator-setup.mdx`).
* Each page starts with a single H1 that matches the page title.
* Optional frontmatter can declare:

  * `doc_type: tutorial | how-to | explanation | reference`
  * `audience: beginner | advanced`
  * `status: experimental | deprecated`
* If deprecated, add an Important callout at the top with the replacement and timeline.
* Sidebar labels are short (2–4 words) and mirror in‑page headings.

---

## 10) Accessibility and international readers

* Use plain, international English; avoid idioms and culture‑specific references.
* Write descriptive headings and link text.
* Tables have headers and units (e.g., “Latency (ms)”).
* Provide text alternatives for complex figures when feasible.

---

## 11) Secrets, data, and environments

* Never include real keys, mnemonics, or tokens. Use placeholders or clearly invalid test values.
* Prefer environment variables or keystores over inlining secrets.
* Call out any command that can delete, rewrite, or lock state.
* Label the environment explicitly when it matters (testnet vs mainnet).
