This page is a placeholder, a stub. It's here to help visualize the new structure, but it is temporarily devoid of content.

Since it's an "overview" page, its contents will be written after writing the contents of the respective section.

1. All the processes, for tech teams and for third-party contributors.
2. Links to the style guide and `CONTRIBUTING.md[x]`
3. Grants and bounties?
