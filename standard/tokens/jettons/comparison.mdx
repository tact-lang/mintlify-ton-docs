Compare implementations of the TEP-74 standard and which version fits each use case.

## Summary

Jetton 2.0 is the latest and most optimized Jetton implementation. Unlike previous versions, it deploys jetton wallets in the same shardchain as the owner's Toncoin wallet.

See it in action: [Jetton 2.0 repository](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/jetton-contract/tree/jetton-2.0).

## Implementation history

### Jetton 1.0

**Release date**: 2022-04-18

[GitHub commit](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/commit/369ae089255edbd807eb499792a0a838c2e1b272)

Since the [initial TEP-74](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0074-jettons-standard.md) publication on 2022-03-12, this was the first public jetton release. It doesn't support Jetton Wallet Discovery ([TEP-89 standard](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0089-jetton-wallet-discovery.md)) and contains some gas estimation techniques that now are considered bad practice. Overall, this implementation is deprecated and shouldn't be used for any production development.

### Discoverable jetton

**Release date**: 2023-01-19

[GitHub commit](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/commit/f2253cb0f0e1ae0974d7dc0cef3a62cb6e19f806)

For a long time, this version was the most widely adopted in the community. The [Minter UI](https://minter.ton.org/) deploys jettons with this code. It includes the minimum required features, but isn't optimized for the latest TON Virtual Machine (TVM) and blockchain changes. Also, the repository doesn't include advanced tests or scripts.

### Stablecoin contract

**Release date**: 2024-04-14

[GitHub commit](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/stablecoin-contract/commit/7a22416d4de61336616960473af391713e100d7b)

With the Tether USD (USDT) release on TON, an advanced version of the Jetton contract was developed. This version introduces many new TVM gas assertion techniques, as well as extended functionality. Since USDT is a centralized asset, there are certain requirements and restrictions for its operations. More specifically, there is no `burn` opcode, meaning that formally the governance contract is not TEP-compliant, since jetton burn functionality is a part of the standard. Also, the minter contract includes a governance mechanism that allows performing any actions on other jetton wallets.

Another noticeable advantage of this implementation is extensive testing. All previous versions didn't test edge cases of config changes that affect storage and forward fees. This test suite became the foundation for all future jetton versions.

### Notcoin contract

**Release date**: 2024-04-25

[GitHub commit](https://github.com/OpenBuilders/notcoin-contract/commit/c9992514b71f1775cec5df49fbea31a85ddd87f9)

This version is straightforward — it is a forked stablecoin contract with the governance functionality removed and a burn mechanism added. Until recently, it was the best suited jetton for a basic on-chain coin use case.

### Mintless jetton

**Release date**: 2024-09-22

[GitHub commit](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/mintless-jetton-contract/commit/77763e6b2df6cf96b0840c7306844751200ff046)

During periods of large on-chain airdrops and centralized exchange (CEX) listings, there was a demand for a cheap and easy way of initial jetton distribution. You can read more about the history in the [airdrop](/standard/tokens/airdrop) page. This version is also made from the stablecoin contract with removed governance and allowed burn. It allows for Merkle proof airdrops, enabling the minting of jettons directly on the jetton wallet contract in a decentralized manner. The implementation is designed to support large-scale airdrops without incurring high costs or placing significant load on the blockchain.

Mintless jetton is the only widely known implementation that uses the `custom_payload` field in the original `transfer#0f8a7ea5` Type Language Binary (TL-B). After the initial claim, each jetton wallet can be used as a regular jetton (which it is).

To use Mintless jetton to its full extent, you will need to cooperate with wallets for additional indexing and payload creation.

### Jetton 2.0

**Release date**: 2025-08-01

[GitHub commit](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/jetton-contract/commit/f2fb1fbb65d8e8ce6ec9f813f3e3dfab9268912a)

This is the latest jetton implementation. It utilizes new shardchain optimizations — the jetton wallet holding a user's token balance is now always deployed in the same shardchain as the owner's wallet. This became possible after the TON node introduced functionality to deploy smart contracts into a specific shardchain (`StateInit.fixed_prefix_length`).

It makes transfers and operations with Jetton 2.0 up to 3 times faster under heavy network load compared to jettons of the previous versions. This version is recommended for all new projects working with jettons.
