This article compares different kinds of Tokens in TON.

The TON blockchain supports three distinct categories of digital tokens, each designed to serve different purposes within the ecosystem. Jettons function as fungible tokens similar to traditional currencies, NFTs represent unique digital assets, and Soul-bound tokens provide immutable credentials and identity markers.

## Jettons (Fungible Tokens)

Jettons (TEP-74 standard) serve as TON's counterpart to Ethereum's [ERC-20 tokens](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20), functioning as the primary means of representing monetary value and fungible assets within the TON ecosystem. These tokens embody the principle of fungibility, where each unit holds identical value and can be seamlessly exchanged with any other unit of the same token type.

Token holders can divide their Jettons into smaller fractions, making them suitable for precise financial transactions. This divisibility enables microtransactions and fine-grained value transfers that are essential for modern digital economies.

Stablecoins like USDT rely on Jetton standard to represent monetary value on-chain. Governance systems frequently employ Jettons as voting mechanisms, where token holders can participate in decentralized decision-making processes. DeFi protocols distribute Jettons as rewards for liquidity provision, staking participation, or other beneficial behaviors that support protocol health. Gaming platforms utilize Jettons as in-game currencies, enabling players to trade assets and participate in virtual economies.

The technical architecture of Jettons reflects TON's distributed design principles. Rather than storing all token information in a single contract, the system employs a distributed approach where each user maintains their own Jetton wallet contract. The main Jetton contract functions as a central registry, storing essential metadata and tracking total supply, while individual wallet contracts handle user-specific balances and execute transfer operations. This architecture enhances scalability and reduces congestion compared to centralized token models.

## Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)

Non-Fungible Tokens (TEP-62) represent the digital embodiment of uniqueness within the TON ecosystem. Unlike their fungible counterparts, each NFT possesses distinct characteristics that make it irreplaceable and non-interchangeable. This fundamental property of uniqueness enables NFTs to serve as digital certificates of authenticity for a vast array of digital and physical assets.

The power of NFTs lies in their ability to prove verifiable ownership of digital assets through blockchain technology. Each token carries a unique identifier and associated metadata that distinguishes it from every other token in existence. This uniqueness makes NFTs particularly valuable for representing assets where individual characteristics matter significantly.

Digital art represents one of the most prominent applications of NFT technology. Artists can tokenize their creations, ensuring provable ownership and enabling new revenue models through primary sales and secondary market royalties. Collectors gain confidence in their acquisitions, knowing that blockchain technology guarantees the authenticity and provenance of their digital art pieces.

The technical implementation of NFTs in TON mirrors the distributed architecture philosophy found in Jettons. Individual item contracts represent each NFT, while collection contracts manage overall collection metadata and coordinate minting processes. This distributed approach ensures that NFT operations remain efficient and scalable even as collections grow to encompass thousands or millions of individual tokens.

## Soul-bound Tokens (SBTs)

Soul-bound Tokens represent a revolutionary concept in digital identity and credential management within the TON blockchain. These tokens embody permanence and non-transferability, creating an immutable link between specific credentials and their holders' blockchain addresses. The term "soul-bound" references the permanent binding of these tokens to their recipient's digital identity or "soul."

The defining characteristic of SBTs lies in their non-transferable nature. Once issued to a specific address, these tokens cannot be moved, sold, or transferred to any other address. This permanent association ensures that achievements, credentials, and identity markers remain authentically connected to their rightful owners, preventing fraud and misrepresentation in digital credential systems.

Academic institutions find SBTs particularly valuable for issuing tamper-proof diplomas and certificates. Traditional paper-based credentials are vulnerable to forgery and require manual verification processes. SBTs eliminate these concerns by providing cryptographically secure, instantly verifiable academic achievements that remain permanently associated with graduates' blockchain identities.

Professional qualification systems benefit significantly from SBT implementation. Medical licenses, legal certifications, engineering credentials, and other professional qualifications can be issued as SBTs, creating a global, instantly verifiable database of professional competencies. Employers and clients can verify qualifications immediately without contacting issuing authorities or waiting for manual verification processes.

Reputation systems leverage SBTs to create trustworthy, portable reputation scores that individuals can carry across different platforms and services. Unlike centralized reputation systems that trap user reputation within specific platforms, SBT-based reputation travels with users, enabling more efficient trust-building in decentralized environments.

Access control mechanisms employ SBTs as membership proofs and permission tokens. Organizations can issue SBTs to members, granting access to exclusive services, communities, or resources. The non-transferable nature ensures that membership benefits cannot be sold or shared inappropriately, maintaining the integrity of exclusive access systems.

Identity verification processes increasingly rely on SBTs for KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) compliance. Financial institutions and regulated services can issue compliance tokens to verified users, enabling streamlined onboarding processes while maintaining regulatory compliance. Users benefit from portable verification status that reduces repeated identity verification requirements.

Event attendance and participation can be permanently recorded through SBTs. Conference organizers, educational institutions, and community groups can issue attendance certificates that provide lasting proof of participation. These tokens serve as digital achievement badges that accumulate over time, creating comprehensive records of individual engagement and learning.

The technical foundation of SBTs builds upon existing NFT infrastructure while implementing transfer restrictions. SBTs inherit the uniqueness and metadata capabilities of NFTs but incorporate smart contract logic that prevents transfer operations. This design ensures that tokens remain permanently bound to their original recipients while maintaining all the verification and authenticity benefits of blockchain technology.

## Understanding Token Distinctions

The three token types within TON each serve fundamentally different purposes and exhibit distinct behavioral characteristics. Jettons prioritize fungibility and transferability, making them ideal for monetary applications where individual token identity matters little. NFTs emphasize uniqueness and verifiable ownership while maintaining transferability, perfect for assets where individual characteristics create distinct value propositions.

Soul-bound Tokens sacrifice transferability to achieve permanent association with specific identities, creating ideal solutions for credentials and achievements where portable, verifiable ownership matters more than market liquidity. These distinctions guide developers and users toward appropriate token choices based on specific use case requirements and desired behavioral characteristics.

The evolution of token standards continues as the TON ecosystem matures. Each token type follows specific Technical Enhancement Proposals (TEPs) that define standard interfaces and behavioral expectations. Jettons adhere to TEP-0074, NFTs follow TEP-0062, and SBTs implement TEP-0085, ensuring interoperability and consistent implementation across different applications and services.

Understanding these token distinctions enables developers to make informed architectural decisions, users to interact appropriately with different token types, and creators to select optimal tokenization strategies for their specific applications and goals within the growing TON ecosystem.
