[Playground link for metadata](/api-reference/accounts/metadata?playground=open)

### Low level
Metadata is split into two parts: one part is stored on the item, another on the collection. We need to merge them.

To get metadata for an NFT of a particular index, first fetch the NFT item address from the collection, then read the item metadata, then combine it with the collection metadata to get the final result.
