This page compares the two layers of the NFT protocol on TON — `Collection` and `Item` — and the most common implementations for each. Each layer can be swapped independently because the contracts do not depend on a specific counterpart implementation.

<Aside type="note" title="Scope">
This page focuses on high‑level capabilities and typical trade‑offs. For low‑level details, see [How it Works](/standard/tokens/nft/how-works).
</Aside>

## Collection

Short overview:

- Default Collection: canonical implementation.
- A cNFT (compressed NFT) combines a [standard NFT](/standard/tokens/nft/overview) with an [airdrop‑style distribution](/standard/tokens/airdrop), optimized for large distributions and shifting minting costs from the creator to end users via Merkle‑proof based self‑deployment. 

| Capability | Default Collection | cNFT Collection |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deployment & minting flow | Items are minted by the creator | Any user with a valid proof can deploy their item |
| Who pays for item deployment | Creator in most flows | Costs shifted to the audience |
| Eligibility/allowlist | Custom off‑chain/on‑chain logic, usually controlled by creator | On‑chain Merkle allowlist, root readable via `get_merkle_root` |
| Minting permissions | Typically restricted to the creator | Open to any user who provides a valid Merkle proof |
| Typical use cases | Curated drops, controlled minting | Mass airdrops, growth campaigns, very large audiences |
| Key trade‑offs | Creator bears mint costs; tighter control | Lower creator cost; proof UX and distribution setup required |

### Additional: Royalty

Royalty is defined at the collection level and exposed via `get_royalty_params` ([TEP‑66](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/1e5b2c4c8290d88d6bc3ddc4729812e3ac232c00/text/0066-nft-royalty-standard.md)). Any collection implementation can follow this model.

Это нужно для маркетов, all NFT markets will pay royalty to collection author independently of how this collection was deployed.

## Item

Short overview:

- Default Item: fully transferable NFT item that implements the standard transfer operation.
- SBT (Soulbound Token): a non‑transferable NFT bound to a specific owner by design.

| Capability | Default Item | SBT (Soulbound Token) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Transferability | Yes | No |
| Typical use cases | Art, collectibles, tickets, gaming assets | Identity, credentials, achievements, non‑transferable badges |


### SBT 
An SBT inherits the uniqueness and metadata model of NFTs but disables transfer operations, binding the token permanently to the recipient's address after mint. This makes SBTs well‑suited for identity and credentials: attendance records, participation proofs, and non‑transferable achievements.


## Single NFT (no collection)

A Single NFT is an item contract deployed without an associated collection. It keeps the same ownership semantics but omits shared collection metadata and indexing.

- When to use: one‑off assets, experimental pieces, or cases where collection‑level coordination is unnecessary.
- Metadata: stored entirely on the item.
- Discoverability: there is no collection index, external indexers or explicit links are used to surface the item.
- Trade‑offs: simpler setup but fewer shared features (no collection‑wide royalty/config, no batch queries by index).
