- What is the difference between types of tokens?
    - For example, SBTs are not transferable
- https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/tree/master

- even though there are standard TEPs, we're also including other impactful ecosystem contracts

## Wallet

- v5 - proxies internal messages from other contracts: used for gasless transactions
- v1-4 - older versions, less features, less efficient
- highload - when you need to send a lot of transactions FROM the wallet: exchanges, payment
- multisig - voting wallet: several owners have to vote for sending transactions
- lockup - vesting wallet: money become available after a period of time
- preprocessed - optimized v3, have data embedded in the code to make transactions cheaper
- restricted - can only send to 1 address

## Tokens

- jetton = token
    - if it ends with "token" it doesn't mean it's always a Jetton
- toncoin vs token, how to select
- jetton - just coins of new type
    - usdt
- nft - each coin is different from each other
    - you have a piece of art, and you own it
- sbt - nft + has only one owner and cannot be transferred
    - you took part in event, you got an sbt for taking part in it

## Jettons

- TEP
- stablecoin (+ status, governance)
- mintless jettons
    - don't need an extra transaction to create tokens on-chain
    - transfers use an off-chain proof
    - can be used for **airdrop**

## NFT

- TEP
- cNFT
- fragment NFT
- getgems
- SBT

## DEX

DEX vs CEX, link to CEX
uniswap v2 vs v3

## Staking/vesting

- staking - returns money after period of time
- vesting - returns money by portion

## Governance

Say this is TON internals

- Elector - selecting a validator for a round
- Config - blockchain config storage
- Nominator pool - a way to pool money of several validators
- Single nominator pool - same interface, but when one validator has enough money
