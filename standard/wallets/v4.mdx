This article provides overview of V4 wallet standard.

This version retains all the functionality of the previous versions but also introduces something very powerful: `plugins`.

Wallet source code:

- [ton-blockchain/wallet-contract](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/wallet-contract)

This feature allows developers to implement complex logic that works in tandem with a user's wallet. For example, a DApp may require a user to pay a small amount of coins every day to use certain features. In this case, the user would need to install the plugin on their wallet by signing a transaction. The plugin would then send coins to the destination address daily when requested by an external message.

## TL-B schemes

```tlb
// External message body for V4 wallet
signed_request$_ subwallet_id:(## 32) valid_until:(## 32)
  msg_seqno:(## 32) opcode:(## 32) = SignedRequest;

external_signed#_ signature:(bits 512) signed:SignedRequest = ExternalMsgBody;

// Simple send (opcode = 0x0)
simple_send$0 mode:(## 8) msg_ref:^Cell = OutAction;

// Deploy and install plugin (opcode = 0x1)
deploy_plugin$1 workchain:(## 8) balance:VarUInteger16
  state_init:^Cell body:^Cell = OutAction;

// Install plugin (opcode = 0x2)
install_plugin$2 wc_n_address:(## 8) address:(## 256)
  balance:VarUInteger16 query_id:(## 64) = OutAction;

// Remove plugin (opcode = 0x3)
remove_plugin$3 wc_n_address:(## 8) address:(## 256)
  balance:VarUInteger16 query_id:(## 64) = OutAction;
```

## Official code hashes

The "R" in version names stands for "Revision". There are two revisions of V4 because the first revision (R1) had some optimizations applied in the second revision (R2) while maintaining the same functionality. **Use V4 R2** as it is the latest and most optimized version.

| Contract version | Hash                                                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| V4 R1            | `64dd54805522c5be8a9db59cea0105ccf0d08786ca79beb8cb79e880a8d7322d` |
| V4 R2            | `feb5ff6820e2ff0d9483e7e0d62c817d846789fb4ae580c878866d959dabd5c0` |

## Plugins

<Warning>
Installing third-party plugins can be dangerous and may lead to wallet drainage. Only install plugins from trusted sources and ensure you understand their functionality before installation.
</Warning>

Plugins are essentially other smart contracts on TON that developers are free to implement as they wish. In relation to the wallet, they are simply addresses of smart contracts stored in a dictionary in the wallet's persistent memory. These plugins are allowed to request funds and remove themselves from the "allowed list" by sending internal messages to the wallet.

## Persistent memory layout

- <b>seqno</b>: 32-bit long sequence number.
- <b>subwallet_id</b>: 32-bit long subwallet_id. This is a number that allows you to create multiple wallets with the same private key but different addresses.
- <b>public_key</b>: 256-bit long public key.
- <b>plugins</b>: dictionary containing plugins (may be empty).

## Receiving internal messages

All previous versions of wallets had a straightforward implementation for receiving internal messages. They simply accepted incoming funds from any sender, ignoring the internal message body if present, or in other words, they had an empty `recv_internal` method. However, as mentioned earlier, the fourth version of the wallet introduces two additional available operations. Let's take a look at the internal message body layout:

- <b>opcode</b> (optional): 32-bit long operation code. This is an optional field. Any message containing less than 32 bits in the message body, an incorrect opcode, or a sender address that isn't registered as a plugin will be considered a simple transfer, similar to previous wallet versions.
- <b>query_id</b>: 64-bit long integer. This field has no effect on the smart contract's behavior; it is used to track chains of messages between contracts.

1. opcode = `0x706c7567`, request funds operation.
   - <b>Toncoin</b>: [VARUINT16](/tvm/instructions#fa02-stgrams) amount of requested Toncoin.
   - <b>extra_currencies</b>: dictionary containing the amount of requested extra currencies (may be empty).
2. opcode = `0x64737472`, request removal of the plugin that sent this message from the "allowed list".

## External message body layout

- <b>signature</b>: 512-bit long [Ed25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA#Ed25519) signature.
- <b>subwallet_id</b>: 32-bit long subwallet ID.
- <b>valid-until</b>: 32-bit long Unix time integer.
- <b>msg-seqno</b>: 32-bit long sequence number.
- <b>opcode</b>: 32-bit long operation code.

### Simple send (opcode = 0x0)

- <b>(0-4) mode</b>: up to four 8-bit integers defining the sending mode for each message.
- <b>(0-4) messages</b>: up to four references to cells containing messages.

### Deploy and install plugin (opcode = 0x1)

- <b>workchain</b>: 8-bit long integer.
- <b>balance</b>: [VARUINT16](/tvm/instructions#fa02-stgrams) Toncoin amount of initial balance.
- <b>state_init</b>: cell reference containing plugin initial state.
- <b>body</b>: cell reference containing body.

### Install/remove plugin (opcode = 0x2/0x3)

- <b>wc_n_address</b>: 8-bit long compact workchain ID specific to this layout + 256-bit long plugin address.
- <b>balance</b>: [VARUINT16](/tvm/instructions#fa02-stgrams) Toncoin amount of initial balance.
- <b>query-id</b>: 64-bit long integer.

The fourth version provides standard functionality through the `0x0` opcode, similar to previous versions (see [wallet overview](/standard/wallets/overview) for details on message layout). The `0x2` and `0x3` operations allow manipulation of the plugin dictionary. Note that in the case of `0x2`, you need to deploy the plugin with that address yourself. In contrast, the `0x1` opcode also handles the deployment process with the `state_init` field.

## Exit codes

| Exit code | Description                                                             |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 33        | `seqno` check failed, replay protection triggered                       |
| 34        | `subwallet_id` does not match the stored one                            |
| 35        | `Ed25519 signature` check failed                                        |
| 36        | `valid_until` check failed, transaction confirmation attempted too late |
| 39        | Plugins dictionary manipulation failed (0x1-0x3 recv_external opcodes) |
| 80        | Not enough funds for the funds request                                  |
| 0         | Standard successful execution exit code.                                |

## Get methods

1. `int seqno()` returns current stored seqno.
1. `int get_public_key()` returns current stored public key.
1. `int get_subwallet_id()` returns current subwallet ID.
