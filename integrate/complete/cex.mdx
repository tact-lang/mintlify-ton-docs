title: "How to integrate TON into a Centralized Exchange (CEX)"
---

This guide walks you through integrating Toncoin (TON) into your centralized exchange infrastructure. You’ll learn how to:

- Create and fund a testnet wallet  
- Deploy and sync a liteserver node  
- Connect SDKs to your own node and Toncenter API  
- Simulate trace flows and handle deposit/withdrawal logic  
- Monitor transaction finality and infrastructure health  

This guide is designed for backend engineers working on CEX infrastructure from MVP integration to production readiness.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before starting the integration process, make sure your environment meets the following:

### System Requirements
- macOS, Linux, or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)  
- Git and curl installed  
- Telegram account (used for faucet access)  

### Node Hardware Requirements
- **CPU:** 16 cores minimum  
- **RAM:** 128 GB  
- **Storage:** 1 TB+ NVMe SSD (64,000+ IOPS)  
- **Bandwidth:** 1 Gbps, 16 TB monthly traffic budget  
- **Network:** Static public IP address  

### Provider Requirements
For production, use self-hosted or dedicated bare-metal servers. If using cloud, choose from the [recommended providers](https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/nodes/running-nodes/full-node#recommended-providers) list and ensure consistent IOPS, high throughput, and a fixed public IP.

## 2. Hot Wallet Setup

Before integrating TON into your backend, you’ll need a hot wallet to run test transactions.  

A **hot wallet** is a cryptocurrency wallet that stays connected to the internet, enabling fast transactions. This differs from a **cold wallet**, which remains offline for long-term storage and maximum security. There are different ways to create hot wallets in TON, and you can choose any method that fits your workflow, but for simplicity, we will use **Tonkeeper**.

<Note>Testnet wallets should only be used for development. For production, switch to mainnet to ensure accurate fee calculation, transaction finality, and live trace verification.</Note>

### 2.1 Create Wallet with Tonkeeper

Tonkeeper is a widely used TON mobile wallet that allows you to create a working address in minutes, which you can later import into your SDK for automated testing.  

To use Tonkeeper:
1. Download the [Tonkeeper mobile app](https://tonkeeper.com/).  
2. Go to **Settings → Wallets → Add Wallet → Testnet Account**.  
3. Save the 24-word seed phrase securely and copy the generated wallet address.  

Your TON wallet address can be represented in two formats:

- **Base64 address** – A user-friendly, encoded version designed for readability and safety.  
  This format includes a checksum to help prevent errors when copying or sending funds.   **Example (Base64):**  
`UQBlXWdp1eP7W8RGeaH4vM86Y/8rT1hY+7XfF1t4dKQ=`

- **Raw HEX address** – The low-level representation containing the workchain ID and account ID.  
This is the direct blockchain reference to your wallet’s smart contract and is used in technical or SDK-based operations.
**Example (Raw HEX):** `-1\:fcb91a3a3816d0f7b8c2c76108b8a9bc5a6b7a55bd79f8ab101c52db29232260`

You can use the [TON Address Tool](https://ton.org/address) to convert between formats and view mainnet or testnet variations.

### 2.2 Request Testnet TON

Every transaction on TON requires a small amount of Toncoin to cover **network gas** and **forwarding fees**.  
Before you can test deposits, withdrawals, or fee estimation, you’ll need to fund your hot wallet with testnet TON.  

There are two main ways to do this:

#### Option A – Request from TON Team (Recommended)

For CEX integration testing, the most reliable method is to request Testnet funds directly from the [TON Support team on Telegram](https://t.me/tonblockchain).  
This way, you’ll have enough balance to run tests continuously without frequent top-ups.  

#### Option B – Telegram Faucet (Quick Start)

If you only need a small amount for initial or manual testing, use the public faucet:  
1. Open Telegram and start the [@test_giver_ton_bot](https://t.me/test_giver_ton_bot).  
2. Paste your testnet wallet address. The bot will send **2 TON** to your address.  

<Warning>You can only request once per hour. For repeated or automated testing, use <b>Option A</b> to get a larger Testnet allocation and avoid interruptions.</Warning>

----

### 2.3 Verify Balance via Explorer

After requesting TON, confirm that your wallet has been funded by using one of these official testnet explorers:

- [testnet.tonscan.org](https://testnet.tonscan.org)  
- [testnet.tonviewer.com](https://testnet.tonviewer.com)  

Paste your wallet address into the search bar. You should see:

- **Balance:** `2 TON` (or more, if you’ve made repeated requests)  
- **Address:** (your wallet address)  
- **State:** `uninit` or `inactive`  

<Note>If you see <code>nonexist</code>, it means the balance of the account is 0 or the contract does not have any data.</Note>
