title: "Mainnet and testnet"
---

TON Center supports both **mainnet** and **testnet** environments for all API versions.

The testnet is ideal for development and testing. It mirrors the functionality of the mainnet but uses separate smart contracts and tokens with no real-world value.

## Base URLs

| Environment | API v2 | API v3 |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| **Mainnet** | `https://toncenter.com/api/v2` | `https://toncenter.com/api/v3` |
| **Testnet** | `https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v2` | `https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v3` |

Simply replace the base URL in your requests depending on your environment.

<Note>
You can check out the Testnet API in the [API playground](../../api-reference/accounts/get-address-information) by selecting the testnet URL from the dropdown menu.

## Usage Notes

- No real TON is needed on testnet.
- You still need an API key for higher rate limits, [get one here](https://t.me/toncenter).
- Ideal for testing wallets, contracts, and integrations without affecting live data.
