Learn how to develop on The Open Network (TON) coming from the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem.

  This guide only covers basic principles and tooling around them. If you want
  a more practical example, see [Tokens on TON](/guidebook/tokens).

## Execution model

### Asynchronous blockchain

One of the biggest challenges when learning TON development is the asynchronous execution model. Messages sent by one contract take time to arrive to another, meaning that the resulting transaction, for incoming message processing, will happen after the current transaction terminates.

So compared to Ethereum, where you can have multiple processed messages and state changes on different contracts in the same atomic transaction, on TON, a transaction represents a state change only for one account and a single message processing. A signed, included‑in‑block unit is called a transaction in both chains; however, due to different execution models, the impact differs.

Here is a table for comparison:

| Action description                                                                             | Ethereum                          | TON                       |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Single message processing with state change on one contract                                    | Message call or internal transaction | Transaction               |
| Number of state changes and messages on different accounts produced from initial contract call | Transaction                       | Chain of transactions (trace) |

Example: liquidity withdrawal on a decentralized exchange (DEX).

On Ethereum it will look like this, single atomic transaction, with multiple contract calls inside it. You can see that this transaction has a single hash and included in one block:

![Ethereum DEX liquidity withdrawal shown as one atomic transaction](/resources/images/from-ethereum/burn-tx-eth.png)

The same operation on TON will be different, it will consist of more than 10 transactions, triggered by one another. Each arrow on this image represents a distinct finalized transaction, with its own hash, inclusion block and all the other properties:

![TON DEX liquidity withdrawal shown as a chain of transactions (trace)](/resources/images/from-ethereum/burn-tx-ton.png)

If you want to execute a large transaction on Ethereum (or any other EVM-based blockchain), you will have certain limitations: [EVM call-depth](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/evm/#evm-instructions) of 1024 nested calls and [block gas limit](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/blocks/#block-size). With the TON asynchronous execution model, you can have a trace (chain of transactions) of whatever length you want, as long as you have fees to continue it. For example, [the trace that resulted from this message](https://tonviewer.com/transaction/e887503f7dac857be80487e3ed0774db962379d1c153e6df7b9b5313c657ab94) consisted of more than 1,500,000 transactions, lasting more than 4,000 blocks until its end.

### On-chain get methods

Another radical difference between two chains is get methods, a way to retrieve some data from the contracts without paying any fees. In TON you _can't_ synchronously retrieve data from another contract — you can't call a get method from another contract during a transaction.

If you wonder how we can make any decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol or complicated on-chain system work with these limitations, read an article about the on-chain [Request‑Response pattern](/techniques/carry-value).

### Account model

There are two types of accounts in Ethereum: externally owned account (EOA) and contract accounts. EOAs are human-controlled entities, each represented by a private–public key pair. They are used to sign transactions and each has its own balance; they are commonly called wallets by the community.

In TON, there is no such separation. Every valid address represents an on-chain account, each with its own state and balance, that can be changed through transactions (read more about accounts [here](/ton/addresses/addresses-general-info)). This means that wallets in TON are smart contracts that operate under the same rules as any other contract on the blockchain.

TON wallet smart contracts use familiar asymmetric cryptography to control message signing, meaning that the user experience stays the same. You can examine the [wallet standard](/standard/wallets/comparison) implementation and how it has changed as the ecosystem evolved.

### Limited contract storage

In Ethereum, you can store as much data as you want in a single contract. Unbounded maps and arrays are considered a normal practice, and you will probably see them in most contract examples. This is not the case with TON — every smart contract on the TON Blockchain has a storage size upper limit. That means that you can't implement ERC20-like fungible tokens in the same way as in an EVM chain, by using a single map inside one contract.

[The limit](/ton/config) is 65,536 unique cells per message or contract storage. Each cell is up to 1,023 bits, which sets a hard upper limit.

<Aside

  Every map expected to grow beyond 1,000 values is risky. In the TVM, map key access is logarithmic, so gas cost increases as the map grows. Use sharding to split state.
</Aside>

Use [sharding](/ton/shards) instead.

You can read more about TON architecture design choices that have led to such differences [here](/standard/overview).

## Ecosystem

### Tooling

<Aside>
  This section will mostly focus on TypeScript tooling since historically this language is better adopted and well established in TON.
</Aside>

The recommended programming language for smart contract development in TON is [Tolk](/language/tolk). However, there are other established languages in the ecosystem. Read more about [Tact](/language/tact).

Another important library to know about is [`@ton/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ton/core). This library handles low-level blockchain primitives (de-)serialization; you will probably need it together with any RPC client or contract interaction library.

### Services

Web3 developers also have their favorite set of products and services that they use for easier on-chain development. This table showcases some of the use cases that existing TON services can cover.

### Standards

This section showcases a match between some Ethereum standards and proposals (ERC and EIP) and their counterparts or similar proposals in TON (TEP).

<Aside>
  Because of major differences in execution models, most of the standards in TON are quite different in semantics and general approach compared to their Ethereum analogs.
