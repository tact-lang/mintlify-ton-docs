USDT (Tether USD) is a stablecoin on TON blockchain that represents US dollars. Each USDT token is designed to be worth $1. This guide will help you understand how to work with USDT on TON.

## What is USDT on TON?

USDT on TON is a jetton (TON's token standard, similar to ERC-20 on Ethereum). Like all jettons, USDT has a **Jetton Master contract** that identifies the token.

<Aside type="warning" title="Verify the Jetton Master address!">
The authentic USDT Jetton Master address is:

```
EQCxE6mUtQJKFnGfaROTKOt1lZbDiiX1kCixRv7Nw2Id_sDs
```

**Any token with a different Jetton Master address is NOT real USDT.** Always verify this address before accepting or purchasing USDT. Scammers can create fake tokens with similar names.

You can view the official USDT Jetton Master contract on [TON Viewer](https://tonviewer.com/EQCxE6mUtQJKFnGfaROTKOt1lZbDiiX1kCixRv7Nw2Id_sDs).

## How jettons work

Unlike TON coins, jettons use a distributed architecture:

- **Jetton Master contract**: The main contract that contains metadata and tracks total supply
- **Jetton Wallet contracts**: Each user has their own jetton wallet contract that holds their balance

When you "have USDT", you actually have a personal USDT wallet contract associated with your regular TON wallet address.

## How to send USDT

Sending USDT requires you to interact with your personal USDT jetton wallet. Here's how:

### Prerequisites

Before sending USDT, make sure you have:

1. USDT balance in your wallet
2. Some TON coins (approximately 0.1 TON) to pay for transaction fees. Real commission will be lower than that, excess will be returned.
3. The recipient's TON wallet address

### Using a wallet app

The easiest way to send USDT is through a wallet app like [Tonkeeper](/ecosystem/wallet-apps/tonkeeper) or other [TON wallet apps](/ecosystem/wallet-apps/overview):

1. Open your wallet app
2. Go to your USDT balance
3. Tap "Send" or "Transfer"
4. Enter the recipient's address
5. Enter the amount of USDT to send
6. Optionally add a comment/memo
7. Confirm and sign the transaction

### Programmatic transfer

If you're building an application, you need to send a special message to your jetton wallet.
To do this, you need to:
- [Find your USDT jetton wallet address](/standard/tokens/jettons/how-to-find)
- [Create the correct transfer message](/standard/tokens/jettons/how-to-transfer)
- Attach sufficient TON for fees

<Aside type="tip">
If you want to send suggest users to transfer USDT through your dApp, you can use the [TON Connect](/ecosystem/ton-connect). This library allows you to propose a message to user. The user will decide, whether to send it or not.
</Aside>

### Important notes about sending programmatically

- **Amount format**: USDT uses 6 decimals. To send 1 USDT, use `1000000` (in elementary units).
- **Gas fees**: Always attach enough TON (~0.1 TON) to cover fees
- **Forward amount**: You should always set `forward_amount` to a positive number. This amount will be credited to the recipient's TON wallet along with the USDT.
- **Comments**: You can add a text comment that will be visible to the recipient

## How to receive USDT

Receiving USDT as an end user is straightforward. Share your TON wallet address. However, **programmatically processing incoming USDT payments is more complex than it appears**.

For businesses, exchanges, or services that need to programmatically detect and process incoming USDT payments, refer to the [payment processing guide](/ecosystem/processing/overview).

### Why is receiving complex?

When someone sends you USDT:

1. They send a message to **their** USDT jetton wallet
2. Their jetton wallet sends a message to **your** USDT jetton wallet
3. Your jetton wallet may send you a notification message (if forward amount > 0)

This multi-step process requires:
- Monitoring the correct jetton wallet address
- Understanding the message chain
- Parsing jetton transfer notifications
- Handling edge cases (first-time receives, insufficient gas, etc.)

## How to find your USDT jetton wallet address

Your USDT jetton wallet address is different from your main TON wallet address. To find it:

### Using TON Viewer

1. Go to [TON Viewer](https://tonviewer.com/)
2. Enter your TON wallet address
3. Click on the "Tokens" tab
4. Find USDT in the list
5. Clicking on USDT will show
5. Your USDT jetton wallet address will be shown

### Programmatically

You can call the `get_wallet_address` method on the USDT Jetton Master contract:

```typescript
import { Address } from "@ton/core";
import { TonClient } from "@ton/ton";

const client = new TonClient({
  endpoint: 'https://toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC',
});

const USDT_MASTER = Address.parse('EQCxE6mUtQJKFnGfaROTKOt1lZbDiiX1kCixRv7Nw2Id_sDs');
const myWalletAddress = Address.parse('YOUR_TON_WALLET_ADDRESS');

// Call get_wallet_address on the master contract
const result = await client.runMethod(USDT_MASTER, 'get_wallet_address', [
  { type: 'slice', cell: beginCell().storeAddress(myWalletAddress).endCell() }
]);

const myUsdtWalletAddress = result.stack.readAddress();
console.log('My USDT wallet:', myUsdtWalletAddress.toString());
```
