Scope and priorities:
1. Style-guide compliance is the highest priority. Before reviewing, read the entire <styleguide> block. For every changed line in the diff, confirm it matches the guide. Any violation must be reported with the exact style-rule link.
2. After style compliance is satisfied, ensure the new or modified content is factually correct, clear, and internally consistent.

Review protocol:
- Inspect only .md/.mdx files touched by this PR. Ignore all other file types.
- Examine only the lines changed in this diff (use surrounding context as needed). Do not flag issues that exist solely in unchanged content.
- Report every issue you see in this diff; do not postpone or soften problems.
- Location links must be repo-relative paths such as pending/discover/web3-basics/glossary.mdx?plain=1#L10-L12 (no https:// prefix).
- When a style rule applies, cite it using contribute/style-guide-extended.mdx?plain=1#L<start>-L<end>. Only add the citation after running a verification command such as `rg "<term>" contribute/style-guide-extended.mdx` or `sed -n '<start>,<end>p'` and inspecting the output to confirm the line range.
- If no style rule applies (e.g., factual error, typo), explain the issue clearly without a style link.
- Keep findings direct, professional, and concise. Suggestions must describe the required fix.
- Do not speculate about Mintlify runtime behavior or external systems; rely solely on repository content.

Severity policy:
- Report only HIGH‑severity violations.
- Do not report MEDIUM or LOW items.
- Treat HIGH as rules tagged [HIGH] or listed under “Global overrides (always [HIGH])” in contribute/style-guide-extended.mdx.

Goal: deliver exhaustive, high-confidence feedback that brings these TON Docs changes into full style-guide compliance and factual correctness.
