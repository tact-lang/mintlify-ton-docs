## How TON Connect works

TON Connect enables communication between **wallets** and **DApps** (Decentralized Applications) within the TON ecosystem.

### Interaction model

* **Wallets** provide user interfaces for approving transactions and securely store cryptographic keys on users’ devices.
* **DApps** built on TON offer rich functionality and secure user funds through the use of smart contracts.

This separation of responsibilities enables rapid innovation and enhances security: _wallets are not tied to closed ecosystems, and DApps do not hold users’ accounts_.

**TON Connect** bridges wallets and apps, providing users with a seamless and secure connection experience.

## Why use TON Connect

- **Seamless integration**: quickly connects TON wallets to DApps with minimal setup and no user friction.
- **Robust security**: uses secure communication to protect user data and transactions.
- **User-friendly experience**: no extra logins required—users interact with DApps directly through their wallets.
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: supports web, mobile, and desktop environments.
- **Developer-friendly tools**: provides APIs and tooling for secure, consistent integration.
- **Open-source development**: maintained by the TonTech team and open to community contributions.

### For DApp developers

TON Connect enables tighter integration and better user engagement:

- **Traffic**: attract more users via wallets that support TON Connect.
- **Built-in authentication**: use wallets as user identities—no registration flows needed.
- **Payments**: process Toncoin and USD₮ payments securely through the TON Blockchain.
- **Retention**: let users save and revisit recently opened or favorite apps.

### For wallet developers

Connect your wallet to TON Connect to enable secure and seamless interaction with TON DApps.

## Join the TON ecosystem

To integrate your service with the TON ecosystem, complete the following steps:

* **Implement TON Connect**: integrate the TON Connect protocol into your application.
* **Make a transfer**: use TON libraries to create and send messages. See [Sending messages](/v3/guidelines/ton-connect/cookbook/ton-transfer) for implementation details.
* **Enable payments**: process payments using [TonAPI](https://tonapi.io/) or a custom indexer (e.g., [gobicycle](https://github.com/gobicycle/bicycle)). See the [Payments processing guide](/v3/guidelines/DApps/asset-processing/payments-processing) for more details.
