title: "What is TON Center API?"
---

import { Aside } from '/snippets/aside.jsx';

TON Center provides fast and reliable HTTP APIs for interacting with [The Open Network](https://ton.org), allowing developers to easily access blockchain data for use in wallets, explorers, automation tools, and more.

Because TON nodes use a binary protocol (ADNL), the HTTP API acts as a bridge, translating requests into compatible formats through two main implementations.

---

## API Versions

- **v2 – TON HTTP API**  
  Real-time access to blockchain state using `tonlibjson` and Liteservers.

- **v3 – TON Indexer**  
  PostgreSQL-based indexer that provides stable and queryable access to structured blockchain data. 

<Note>Free access is limited to 1 request per second. To increase limits, request an API key via [@toncenter on Telegram](https://t.me/toncenter) or follow [this guide](./get-api-key).</Note>

## Usage Options

### Hosted

Use the hosted API from TON Center with a [subscription plan](./subscription-plans) that fits your needs:
  - The Free Plan offers 10 requests/sec.
  - Paid plans provide higher rate limits and private liteservers.

### Self-Hosted

Run the APIs on your own infrastructure:
  - [TON HTTP API (v2)](https://github.com/toncenter/ton-http-api)
  - [TON Indexer (v3)](https://github.com/toncenter/ton-indexer)

<Note>Running your own infra means you'll need quite powerful hardware. For example, the minimun requirements for a liteserver are at least 16-core CPU, 128 GB RAM, 1 TB NVMe SSD, and 1 Gbps connection.</Note>
