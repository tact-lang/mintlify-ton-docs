title: "Choosing between v2 and v3"
---

TON offers two distinct API versions, each optimized for different types of use cases. Understanding their core differences will help you choose the best one for your application.

## Overview

| Feature | TON API v2 | TON API v3 |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Backed by | Node (real-time) | Indexer (processed) |
| Data type | Raw, live data | Indexed, structured data |
| Latency | Near-instant | Slight delay due to indexing |
| Query complexity | Basic queries | Complex and flexible queries |
| Stability | Depends on node sync | Stable and consistent |
| Protocol | ADNL via tonlib | PostgreSQL via HTTP API |

## When to Use Each

### Use TON API v2 if:

- You need fast access to the most recent data
- Your app requires near real-time transaction monitoring
- You prefer low-latency, direct communication with TON nodes
- You can manage raw data parsing and less structured responses

TON API v2 is backed directly by TON nodes through the `tonlib` library. This approach favors speed and freshness. Itâ€™s ideal for monitoring account balances, incoming transactions, or building wallet frontends that require quick feedback.

### Use TON API v3 if:

- You want structured, clean data for complex queries
- You prioritize stability over raw freshness
- You are working with historical data or advanced analytics
- You need advanced filters, sorting, or pagination

TON API v3 is powered by a full indexer that reads from the node database and stores parsed data in PostgreSQL. This allows for precise queries on transactions, smart contract calls, NFT ownership, Jetton balances, and more.

## Architecture Details

### TON API v2

TON API v2 connects to the network using the TON-specific ADNL protocol. Since this binary transport is not HTTP-compatible, a middleware service like TON HTTP API is used to bridge the gap, translating HTTP requests into calls through `tonlibjson`.

This makes v2 suitable for developers who want to stay close to the source of truth and are comfortable working with less processed data.

### TON API v3

TON API v3 relies on the TON Indexer stack. This system reads data from the RocksDB database used by full nodes and imports it into PostgreSQL for easier access. The stack includes:

- A PostgreSQL database for indexed data
- A REST API server built with Fiber
- Services that classify and organize blockchain events
- Indexing workers that extract and normalize on-chain data

This setup enables structured responses and advanced querying capabilities.

## Summary

| Use case | Recommended API |
|----------|------------------|
| Live monitoring | v2 |
| Clean historical data | v3 |
| Smart contract insights | v3 |
| Basic wallet balances | v2 |
| NFT or Jetton analytics | v3 |

## Tip

If the data you need is available in v2 and you don't require historical lookups or filters, v2 is usually faster and simpler to integrate.
