This section contains the original documentation written by _Dr. Nikolai Durov_, which is comprised of a series of whitepapers. They provide a comprehensive overview of all aspects of TON.

The code, comments, and documentation may reference "gram" and "nanogram". These are remnants of the original TON code developed by Telegram. Gram cryptocurrency was never issued. The official currency of TON is Toncoin.

<Aside type="caution">
  While most of the information described there holds some truth, those whitepapers are still considered legacy due to lack of updates and gradual integration of their contents into actual documentation pages.
