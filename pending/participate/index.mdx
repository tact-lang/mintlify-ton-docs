This page is a placeholder, a stub. It's here to help visualize the new structure, but it is temporarily devoid of content.

Since it's an "overview" page, its contents will be written after writing the contents of the respective section.

This section is about running and maintaining your own TON nodes, lite servers, HTTP APIs, and all infrastructure-related things. Perhaps, even contract updates, but that might be placed under the "Build" section.
