This section is about integrating TON Blockchain and related technologies into various web2 and web3 products, such as dApps or wallets.

To integrate with TON, the standard wallet connection protocol is used — TON Connect. It is similar to WalletConnect on Ethereum, but made specifically for TON and covers basic integration aspects. For deeper integrations, it's common to utilize various supplementary SDKs and APIs.

## About TON Connect

TON Connect enables secure communication between wallets and decentralized applications, allowing users to authorize transactions while maintaining control of their private keys.

Currently, TON Connect supports over 30 wallets and connects to hundreds of major applications across the TON ecosystem. As the mandatory connection protocol for all Telegram Mini Apps, it serves as the gateway to TON's entire ecosystem of applications and services.

Think of it as the essential infrastructure that your institutional clients will need to access any TON-based services — from DeFi protocols to gaming applications to payment systems.

For technical architecture details: [TON Connect protocol specification on GitHub](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton-connect).
