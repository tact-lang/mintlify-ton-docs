Telegram Mini Apps (TMAs) are web applications that run within the Telegram messenger. They are built using web technologies — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Mini Apps run through Telegram and are instantly accessible to its 900+ million users — without the need for installs or redirects.

## Key features

- **Telegram integration**: Mini Apps run directly within Telegram, with support for launching from chats, groups, or inline queries — no installation required.
- **Cross-platform support**: Works consistently across Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Push notifications**: Bots can send updates and alerts to users at any time, even when the Mini App is not active.
- **User authentication**: Securely authenticate users using Telegram’s built-in login mechanism, with signed user data passed to the app.
- **Bot interaction**: Bots handle backend processing, user interaction, session state, and real-time messaging.
- **Web-based development**: Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, leveraging Telegram’s APIs to create feature-rich applications.
- **Integrated payments**: Supports over 20 providers, including Google Pay and Apple Pay.
- **Monetization**: subscriptions, in-app purchases, and advertising models are supported.
- **Web3 & TON support**: Featuring TON SDK, TON Connect, and token-based transactions, allowing seamless integration with blockchain-powered applications.
- **Community development**: Telegram has a strong developer ecosystem, where third-party developers actively create and share TMAs, fostering innovation and diversity.

## Integrate with TON Connect

Use the TON Connect protocol to establish a secure connection between your TMA and users’ wallets. It enables authentication, transaction signing, and on-chain data access.
