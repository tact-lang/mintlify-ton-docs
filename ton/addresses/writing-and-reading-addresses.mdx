title: "How to: reading and writing addresses"
---

On this page the main issues of interaction with the addresses are described: 
- **how to create and parse**;
- **how to check the validity**;
- **how to convert from one format to another**.

## Using online converter

Perhaps the best user-friendly online parser and address converter in TON blockchain is built into [the main TON page](https://ton.org/address). 
Just paste the address in any format and you be given all possible formats, if it is written correctly. 
Otherwise, you receive a warning that this address is not valid.

## Using SDK

At the moment, there are at least four SDKs for interacting with TON blockchain, written in
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/ton-org/ton);
- [Java](https://github.com/neodix42/ton4j);
- [Go](https://github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go);
- [Python](https://github.com/nessshon/tonutils).

You can use any of them, including for working with addresses. However, we focus here on the most used one: the one written in TypeScript. 
Namely, we examine [this repository](https://github.com/ton-org/ton-core/tree/main/src/address).

The internal addresses are represented as instances of the `Address` class. You can access it in your favorite IDE using the following import.
```typescript
import { Address } from "@ton/core";

// The fields:
readonly workChain: number;
readonly hash: Buffer;
```
As for the external addresses, they are represented as instances of the `ExternalAddress` class. Similarly, you can access it as follows.
```typescript
import { ExternalAddress } from "@ton/core";

// The fields:
readonly value: bigint;
readonly bits: number;
```

 
### How to create, parse, and convert

The creation is simple.
```typescript
// There is a hash validation check inside the Address constructor.
const internalAddress = new Address(some_wc, some_valid_hash); 

const externalAddress = new ExternalAddress(some_value, some_bits);
```
You can parse the internal addresses string and then convert from one format to another as follows.
```typescript
const address1 = Address.parse('EQDKbjIcfM6ezt8KjKJJLshZJJSqX7XOA4ff-W72r5gqPrHF');
const address2 = Address.parse('0:ca6e321c7cce9ecedf0a8ca2492ec8592494aa5fb5ce0387dff96ef6af982a3e');
// or via its convenient wrapper
const address1 = address('EQDKbjIcfM6ezt8KjKJJLshZJJSqX7XOA4ff-W72r5gqPrHF');
const address2 = address('0:ca6e321c7cce9ecedf0a8ca2492ec8592494aa5fb5ce0387dff96ef6af982a3e'); 

// toString arguments: urlSafe, bounceable, testOnly
// default values: true, true, false

console.log(address1.toString()); // EQDKbjIcfM6ezt8KjKJJLshZJJSqX7XOA4ff-W72r5gqPrHF
console.log(address1.toString({urlSafe: false})) // EQDKbjIcfM6ezt8KjKJJLshZJJSqX7XOA4ff+W72r5gqPrHF
console.log(address1.toString({bounceable: false})) // UQDKbjIcfM6ezt8KjKJJLshZJJSqX7XOA4ff-W72r5gqPuwA
console.log(address1.toString({testOnly: true})) // kQDKbjIcfM6ezt8KjKJJLshZJJSqX7XOA4ff-W72r5gqPgpP
console.log(address1.toString({bounceable: false, testOnly: true})) // 0QDKbjIcfM6ezt8KjKJJLshZJJSqX7XOA4ff-W72r5gqPleK
console.log(address1.toRawString()); // 0:ca6e321c7cce9ecedf0a8ca2492ec8592494aa5fb5ce0387dff96ef6af982a3e
address1.toStringBuffer();

console.log(address2.toString()); // EQDKbjIcfM6ezt8KjKJJLshZJJSqX7XOA4ff-W72r5gqPrHF
console.log(address2.toRawString()); // 0:ca6e321c7cce9ecedf0a8ca2492ec8592494aa5fb5ce0387dff96ef6af982a3e
address2.toStringBuffer(); 
```
If you are sure that your string accurately represents the address in raw or user-friendly format, you can also use the following methods.
```typescript
const address1 = Address.parseFriendly('EQDKbjIcfM6ezt8KjKJJLshZJJSqX7XOA4ff-W72r5gqPrHF');
const address2 = Address.parseRaw('0:ca6e321c7cce9ecedf0a8ca2492ec8592494aa5fb5ce0387dff96ef6af982a3e');
```

**However, there is no separate method for parsing external addresses from a string.**

### How to check the validity

The validity of the address is checked at the time of its parsing. An attempt to parse an invalid address will result in the error `Unknown address type`.
However, you can check separately whether this string is a valid address in Raw or user-friendly formats.

```typescript
console.log(Address.isFriendly(address1)) // true
console.log(Address.isRaw(address1)) // false

console.log(Address.isFriendly(address2)) // false
console.log(Address.isRaw(address2)) // true
```
