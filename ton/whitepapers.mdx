import { Aside } from '/snippets/aside.jsx';

The original TON documentation was written by Dr. Nikolai Durov and comprised a series of whitepapers. They provided a comprehensive overview of all aspects of TON.

While most of the information described in the original PDFs holds some truth, those whitepapers are considered legacy due to a lack of updates and gradual integration of their contents into actual documentation pages. Notice that "legacy" here does not mean "outdated", but rather less kept up to date compared to the regular pages.

<Aside>
  The code, comments, and documentation may reference "gram" and "nanogram". These are remnants of the original TON code developed by Telegram. Gram cryptocurrency was never issued. The official currency of TON is Toncoin.
