## TVM debugging and tracing tools

This page lists essential tools for inspecting TVM (TON Virtual Machine) execution, transactions, and opcodes.

### Retracer

- Website: [Retracer](https://retracer.ton.org/)
- Purpose: Inspect the action list (C5), the TVM stack and executed instructions, basic transaction details (sender, contract, amounts, time, logical time (LT), fees, balances), and executor logs
- Typical use cases:
  - Inspect C5 to see full details of performed actions (for example, message mode or balance reservation)
  - Follow the instruction trace and stack changes to pinpoint errors
  - Check executor logs for deeper debugging or issue reports

<Aside>
  You can jump to Retracer directly from explorers like Tonviewer using the transaction hash.

### TxTracer

- Website: [TxTracer](https://txtracer.ton.org/)
- Purpose: Combines Retracer‑style transaction tracing with an Assembly Playground, a Code Explorer (FunC/Tolk → TVM), the TVM Specification (opcodes, stack effects, control flow, disassembly), and Sandbox visualization
- Built by: TON Studio and TON Core
- Typical use cases:
  - Look up TVM instructions and semantics while reading disassembly
  - Investigate invalid opcode and type errors by checking instruction constraints
  - Trace transactions end‑to‑end, similar to Retracer
  - Experiment with assembly, compile code, and inspect VM logs from local tests

### More tools

- [tvm-web-viewer](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/tvm-web-viewer/) — source code for Retracer
- [TVM Explorer](https://tvm-explorer.netlify.app/) — interactive explorer for TVM bytecode and instructions; check how your code compiles to TVM bytecode
- [tact-lang/ton-opcode](https://github.com/tact-lang/ton-opcode) — decompiler from TVM bytecode to Fift assembly
