Merkle proof cells verify that some cell tree data belongs to the full tree. See [Merkle proof cells](../../ton/cells/merkle-proof-cells) for details.
This design allows the verifier to avoid storing the entire tree's content while still being able to verify it using the root hash.

A Merkle proof cell contains exactly 1 reference `c`. Its level `l` (0 â‰¤ l \< 3) is `max{Lvl(c) - 1, 0}`.

Each Merkle proof cell serializes as follows:

- 1 tag byte with value `0x03`;
- the first 256-bit [higher hash](../hashes) of the referenced cell `c` or the [representation hash](cells#standard-cell-representation-and-its-hash)
  of `c` if its level equals 0;
- 2 bytes that store the depth of the deleted subtree that was replaced by the reference.
