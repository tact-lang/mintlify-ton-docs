Library cells allow extending the on-chain deduplication mechanism. This significantly reduces the size of serialized data
and enables efficient storage of incrementally updated data. For details, see [Library cells](../../ton/cells/library-cells#low-level-details).
A library cell always has level 0, so it does not contain higher hashes.

Each library cell is serialized as follows:
- A 1-byte tag that always equals `0x02`.
- The 256-bit [representation hash](./cells#standard-cell-representation-and-its-hash) of the referenced cell.
