title: "Merkle updates"
---

Merkle update cells always have two references, `c1` and `c2`, and behave like a Merkle proof for both. See [Merkle update cells](../../ton/cells/merkle-update-cells)
for details. The level of a Merkle update cell, $0 \le l < 3$, is determined by `max{Lvl(c1) - 1, Lvl(c2) - 1, 0}`.

Each Merkle update cell serializes as follows:

- 1 tag byte with value `0x04`
- the first 256-bit [higher hash](../hashes) of the referenced cell `c1` or the [representation hash](./cells#standard-cell-representation-and-its-hash) of `c1` if its level equals 0
- the same for the second reference `c2`
- 2 bytes that store the depth of the deleted subtree replaced by reference `c1`
- 2 bytes that store the depth of the new subtree referenced by `c2`
