Pruned branch cells represent deleted subtrees of a tree of cells. See [Pruned branch cells](../../ton/cells/prunned-branch-cells).

A pruned branch cell may have any level between 1 and 3, which equals the level of the root of the pruned subtree plus one.
Each pruned branch cell is serialized as follows:
- A 1-byte tag that always equals `1` is stored.
- A byte contains the pruned branch level mask (`1 <= mask <= 7`). The number of hashes stored equals the number of 1 bits in the mask.
- Next, `h * 32` bytes store [representation hashes](tvm/serialization/cells#standard-cell-representation-and-its-hash) of the roots of the pruned subtrees, starting from the last one (where `h` is the number of 1 bits in the mask). For example, if the mask equals `3` (binary `011`), then the pruned branch cell contains representation hashes of the second and the first pruned subtrees in that order, but not the third one.
- Finally, `h * 2` bytes store the depths of the pruned subtrees, starting from the last one.
